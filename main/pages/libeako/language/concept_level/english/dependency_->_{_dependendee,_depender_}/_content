* the word "dependency" is often used to mean thing that some thing x depends on; especially in software development; but this is wrong practice; nothing implies that "dependency" should not denote thing that depend on x;
* hence i suggest to constrain the usage of "dependency" to the dependency relation
* when we want to denote the things with one role only then we have these possibilities
	* using words originating from "depend"
		* "depender" [, "dependent"] := thing that depends
		* "dependee" := thing that is depended on
		* this is similar to { "employer", "employee" }
			* though : an employee as employed, but a dependee is not depended, it is depended on

	* using totally different words
		* "client" := depender
		* "requisite", "supplier", provider := dependee
* dependence <-> dependency
	* "dependency" denotes a relation or an element of it [i mean the "element" in the set theoretical sense];  "dependence" denotes a phenomena
