* quantity, unit
	* they are distinct notions; thus replacing one with the other is never valid
	* unfortunately a lot of people has the bad habbit to use its unit instead of the quantity
	* here are the corrections in some common instances of mistakes of this type
		* "milage" -> distance
		* "tonnage" -> weight
* "electronc" -> "digital"
	* there is a difference between them and neither one contains the other
	* unfortunately most people has the bad habit to use "electronic" when they mean "digital"
		* for example "email" is a usually incorrect term
			* because the underlying physical implementation
				* is not intended to refer to
				* is not even totally electronic
					* a large part of current digital mailing is optical or magnetic
* "{ left | right } hand side"
	* "hand" is irrelevant here
* a "telephone number" is not a number
	* it is just an identifier
	* a number expresses quantity
	* it is only a tradition to use only digits in the identifier text
	* hence please use "telephone identifier" or "tel id" for short instead of "telephone number"
	* the story is the same with "car number plates"
* "hard" -> "difficult"
	* as you do not say "soft" instead of "easy" either
* non-commutative infix binary functions - their symbol should indicate direction
