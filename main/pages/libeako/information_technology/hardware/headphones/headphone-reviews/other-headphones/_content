* Cooler Master MH (751 | 752)
	* i suspect that the difference between the 751 and 752 versions is only that the 752 also contains an inline volume control
		* the 7.1 feature on it is a bullshit, like almost always, it only adds some reverb and perhaps some other effects - it is a conscious and heavy degradation of the sound quality, in all use-cases, just to sell it as something "surround", which attracts the stupid buyers
	* this headphone is incredibly good for the price, which is about 120$ for the 752; thus it is slightly less expansive than AKG K361, Sennheiser HD 569 but better than or equal to those in both comfort and sound quality + it has microphone and volume control
	* comfort is very good, both the headband and the earpads
		* no hotspot on my head
		* no disturbing touch by the earpads
			* this comfort would be good even for an open back
	* microphone sound quality is good
		* perhaps also because it does not do noise filtering
	* isolation is quite good
	* sound quality is good, would be good even for an open headphone
		* laid back, no harshness anywhere, no sibilance at all, clean
		* it can be felt that it is closed but clean relatively for a closed-back
		* stage is not big, much worse than with the HD 569
* AKG, mid tier, open back
	* these have a springy rope based suspension; those ropes are thin and flexible; they sometimes lose their strength, then the headphone sits on the outer ears of the user, instead of on the head-top; this is a problem often mentioned on public forums and my instance also had this problem; my one totally lost its strength, the suspension was sitting in its most long position; i still could wear and use the headphone but was uncomforting
	* the earpads are big and comfy
	* my instance was a 702
		* sound
			* open
			* stage is not small but not bigger than for example with the cheap Superlux open-back 50 mm headphones
			* being open and its transducer having only 40 mm diameter and seeing th edrequency response: i expected the base to be weak; but it was strong enough, clean and tight; was better than the base of Sennheiser 5__ open headphones [like 560S, Game One]
* AKG K361
	* this headphone is over-hyped and over-priced
	* comfort is not good enough for th eprice; nor the earpads, nor the headbend pad
		* the K371 is even more heavy, with the same headbend padding
	* sound
		* would be good, except one problem: the highs are grainy, quite much for such an expensive and hyped headphone type; i heard this grainyness certainly when i equalized it to the diffuse target
			* i read about the K371 somewhere that its highs are smoother
* Audio-Technica ATH-R70x
	* sound
		* stock frequency tuning is very good; it is slightly too much in 100-200, but still overall very good
		* the spatial qualities are good, stage is big, transparent - this suggests to me that it may be good for movies and games, though i myself did not try
		* some fine grain in the highs - this bothered me, i am sensitive to it, made the headphone a non-choice for me
	* comfort
		* suspension arms give good comfort, i almost did not feel where it was on my head
		* the earcups were too small for me, this is also reported by others
* Shure SHR 440 A
	* comfort is very pleasant
	* sound
		* surprisingly good stage for a closed back
			* good size, good distribution over the dimensions
		* fast, energetic
		* slightly sibilant, or rather: woody
		* good separation
		* the closed nature does not show itself, feels like open
* Hifiman HE 400 se
	* comfort
		* headband is deeply padded but still not good enough because of the weight; i regularly get skin ache at the top of my head by its pressure
		* earpads are good; big in diameter and depth
	* sound: bad because sibilanc
		* sibilant; this is the big problem with the sound; otherwise the sound is quite good
		* lacks slam
* Corsair Virtuoso Wireless
	* comfort: 
		* had a little problem with the earpads, they touched my outer ears unpleasantly
		* massy
	* sound is good overall
		* bad stock frequency response - massive dip around 300-500 Hz, massive hill below that
		* good separation
		* sweet
		* no sibilance or other harshness
* Meze 99 Classic
	* this headphone is overpriced by 3 times; its sound is nothing worthy of fame; at least by my perception; i know that "Honest Audiophile" likes it very much
	* base is elevated by much
	* at around 300 Herz some resonance or other problem is present, i could not get rid of it with equalization
	* timbre is woody
* Sennhesier GSP 500
	* sound was okay
		* its transducer is totally different from the transducer of Sennheiser 5__ headphones
	* comfort was not good enough from a Sennheiser
* Behringer BH 470
	* this headphone is designed for travel: it is closed, base is elevated [this is usual with travel headphones], it is small, nice and elegant
	* mids have so prominant dip that equalization is very important with this headphone
	* when equalized: 
		* its sound is lovable, interestingly, i can not explain why
		* it is sibilant slightly, timbre is woody - this feels as noise, hurting resolution
		* it remains muddy, hurting resolution
		* resolution is quite low
	* comfort is good conpared to earcups such small in diameter; but compared for normal earcup size: this is too small and hence the comfort is not good enough for home and office use [when the headphone does not have to be small]
	* durability: i was surprised by the fact that it endured several years of use without sight of deterioriation; it lasted better than its price suggests
