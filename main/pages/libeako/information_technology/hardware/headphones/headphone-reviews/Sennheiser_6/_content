* one of the many if not the most legendary audiophile headphone
* i had and evaluated the 650; this page contains my impressions about it
* the skeleton seems to be strong, gives confidence
	* more than with the Sennheiser 5 types
* comfort is high
	* even higher than with the Sennheiser 5 types, because those contain a small bumb in the inside of the cups
* sound
	* very neutral sounding
	* has dynamism, more than the Sennheiser 5 types
	* it is laid back, but less so than Sennheiser 598 and Game One are
	* has some punch, unlike the Sennheiser 5 types
	* has some real base, more than the Sennheiser 5 types
	* stage is even across the space dimensions but it is small, just at my head surface
	* has some old style, as if i went back into the 80s, similar to the sound of cheap Koss headphones
	* overall
		* good headphone but not great, not up to its fame, at least for me
			* i still enjoy my Superlux 672 more
				* the Superlux has much better separation
				* the Superlux is more melodic, musical, easier to hear the artistic intent, the Sennheiser 650 is boring, compertively
				* the Superlux is more clear, the Sennheiser is very slightly sibilant, comperatively, which may contribute to the false sense of resolution
				* the stage of the 650 is small
			* i do not see a big jump in quality from Sennheiser 560s
