* i researched whether to buy a tube amplifier for myself; i came to the conclusion that it is not worth it
* cheap tube amplifiers often have quality problems; i think i would have to pay about 200 USD for a good tube amplifier; but for that price good solid state amplifiers are buyable
* tubes get used away over half - 2 years, depending on usage; it is difficult to buy replacement tubes
* tubes need more knowledge
* tubes introduce an error into the sound; this error is pleasing, easy to listen to but is still an error in fidelity
