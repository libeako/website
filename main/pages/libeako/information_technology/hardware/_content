		* my experience
			* i had these amplifiers till now:
				* RealtekÂ® ALC887
					* this is integrated onto my cheap motherboard
				* Behringer UMC 22
					* this is an "audio interface, mainly for input amplificaation, the headphone output amplification is only an addition for direct monitoring of the input, not intended for high quality music enjoyment
				* FiiO E10K Olympus 2
					* this is my 1st and only dedicated amp for music enjoyment
			* with my less resolving headphones, like Superlux 681, i did not head much difference between the 3 amplifiers
			* with my Sennheiser Game One, which i guess is a close relative of the the HD 598, i did hear significant, but not huge difference; the motherboard-integrated one was significantly more distorting and had more warm frequency response than the discrete ones; the FiiO E10K was more resolving than the Behringer; it was also more warm, but not so much as the integrated one
