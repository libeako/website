* in this section i describe some basic notion of programming, including syntax, terminology; i use this throughout this site and they are common in functional programming languages; but note : this syntax is not necessarily the real precise syntax of any programming language, but is only similar to them, a mix of what is common in them; by "them" i mean mostly the programming languages haskell, idris, agda, f#, f*, elm, purescript
* comment
	* i will use either of these syntaxes : "// ___", "/___ */", "-- ___", "# ___"
* indentation-significant syntax
	* is what we use, because it is simple, neat and works well in practice
* type annotation
	* (x is a value of type t) is usually written as "x : t"
	* haskell, purescript use double ":"
	* idris, agda use single ":"
	* as type systems get more capable, the use of type annotation is getting more important, it deserves the simple syntax
	* mathematical type theory uses single ":"
* symbol definition
	* (s is a symbol of type t with value v) is written as follows
		* in mathematical text
			* s : t := v
		* many practical programming languages use simply "=" instead of ":="
	* some programming languages make it possible to separate the type annotation from the value assignment into separate lines
		* s : t s = v
* let-expression
	* an expression letting the coder declare a new symbol with scope limited to the expression
	* example
		* let square x = x x in (square a) + (square b)
		* "let", "in" are keywords
* product type

* "algebraic data type"
	* "algebraic data type" construction is just a common name for product and sum type consturction
