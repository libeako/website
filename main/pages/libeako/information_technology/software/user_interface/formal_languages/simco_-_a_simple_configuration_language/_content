* SimCo is to be a simple universal configuration language for practical use
* the name "SimCo" is from the phrase "simple configuration"
* the current state of configuration languages
	* the well known configuration languages are json, yaml, toml, dhall
		* if you know about other noteworthy one then tell me about it
	* json is not for humans; its syntax is heavy, and does not support comments
	* yaml is complex
	* toml comes closer to what i intend but i think an even simpler language is possible
	* dhall has a professional and principled design; it is simple too, but only relatively to its expressive power and safety; but absolutely it is complex, heavy; it is a real programming language; though total, but still a programming language; i can imagine complex configuration tasks where that power is good but many [perhaps the majority of] configuration tasks require only a few simple unrelated properties, expressed as strings; for those tasks involving an almost full programming language seems to me too muc
* the description and design rational of simco
	* simplicity
		* simco is trying to be very simple; the only boundary of this simplicity is that the stock language ought to be usable for simple practical configuration tasks; it does not strive to be a theoretical minimum, it strives to be a practical minimum
		* in case some additional features is needed: it is to be implemented outside of the simco project, on the simco language, interpreting the atomic sicmo property values specially
	* built-in types
		* simco is unityped: the only type is string
		* this is because there is not principled way to draw a boundary around non-string types
			* if boolean is built-in then why not 3-valued logical values [true, false, unknown] too?
			* if integer numbers are built-in then why not rational, then floating point, then complex, then ... numbers too?
			* if date is built-in then why not IP addresses, email addresses, ... too?
	* the basic syntax
		* a basic configuration file consists of a list of properties, their keys and values, separated by " = "
			* name = banana
			* color = yellow
			* taste = sweet
		* keys may contain only regular letters, decimal digits, '-'
		* keys may not be empty
		* the values may not contain leading or ending whitespace; this is for safety
		* neither the keys nor the value are in apostrophes; this is to keep the syntax clean; this suffices, because in the majority of cases the values do not contain leading or ending whitespace; in case they are: the user can apply whatever apostrophe mechanism it likes
		* the value ends at the new-line character; hence multi-line values are not supported directly; this is for the simplicity and cleanness of the syntax
			* multi-line values are not normal in configurations and when one is needed then it is probably healthier anyway to have it in a separate text file and only its file path in the configuration file
	* tree structure
		* the simple properties can be organized into categories
			* boot
				* loader = grub2
				* command = print "hello master"; system-package-manager --update
			* network
				* machine-name = main-pc
		* the names of the categories are keys and have the same syntax as keys of simple properties
		* the indentation encode sthe parent-child relationships between the nodes
		* the indentation is done with tabs
			* motivation
				# links-to internal awitstdmdccwokwln
		* categories can be nested in whatever tree structure, with any depth and complexity
			* system
				* boot
					* loader = grub2
					* command = print "hello master"; system-package-manager --update 
				* network
					* machine-name = main-pc
			* applications = geany firefox tor-browser
			* users
				* -
					* name = john
					* real-world-name = John Doe
				* -
					* name = jane
					* real-word-name = Jane Doe
		* > 1 occurance of the same key, under the same node is allowed
* the recommended file name extension for simco is ".simco.text"
	* ".text" is to signal for the users, who are not familiar with simco, that the file can be viewed and edited with simple text viewer and editor
	* ".simco" is useful for special editors to colorize and otherwise help the editing of simco files specifically
