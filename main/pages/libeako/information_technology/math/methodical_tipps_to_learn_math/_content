* i am not good in human brain science, hence take these advices of i as humble, amature self-experience
* motivation
	* some healthy motivation boosts any activity
		* the economic value math gives is huge and exploding

* when you are stuck
	* that happens often, right ? do not panic, do not give up
	* take some rest
		* the reason why you can not understand something is often that you are approaching it from a wrong direction, with a wrong state of mind, or just tired; all these causes are defeated by some rest; fogetting some of what you already know about a topic can help much in learning it efficiently when you revisit it; this sounds unintuitively but i experience this often and its magic keeps suprising me even after years of learning math; i will refer to this phenomena by "the power of forgetting"
	* use multiple sources, books, blog posts
		* even interleaving them may be a good strategy
		* different authors and writings get different things explained well, this may depend even just on accident
		* re-reading about a mathematical object from a different author will make you feel that the object is important, it is considered to be commonly interesting, not only for a single author that you currently read from [who just wants you to suffer :-)]
		* different perspectives help to get a feeling about how much is strict knowledge and how much is the freedom of the mathematician and application area
		* an example
			* i learned category theory from a "Gentle Introduction" book, that was seemingly designed to be easy for the novice reader; and it really is; still i did not understand the topic "natural transformation" from it; hence i looked elsewhere and found an other book; even though the other book was considered a more advanced one : this particular topic was written in a more short, simple, understandable way, and i understood the main idea from it in a moment
	* when reading a book
		* in case you can not understand something : quickly pre-reading the rest of the book may help; by that acquiring overview, seeing the dependencies between the topics, importance of topics for further developments; then with having this : try to re-read the book, this time with the desire to more strongly understand
* learn some math in every few days
	* math is about understanding, big brain work; the brain can not work without breaks, the brain's productivity falls after getting tired; hence it is good to learn some small portion of math whenever you feel your brain is energetic, your mood is curious
	* in order to get a stable, healthy understanding : the brain has to forget some of the newly understood mathematical knowledge and revisit them after a break ["the power of forgetting"]
	* the summary lesson from this : the absence of many small learning sessions can not be compensated by few long continuous learning sessions
* do not hurry
	* try to understand everyting to the point of feeling it
	* there is much dependence among mathematical objects; hence if one is not understood [fully] then the ones building on it will be much harder to understand
* after understanding
	* understaning is the main thing in math and the most difficult part; when you understood a mathematical object : you are over the difficult part; the rest is easier; but still valueable; hence do not skip it; spend time with the newly learned mathematical knowledge, get a feeling of it, think about it from different perspectives, learn some applications of the object; this will give you depth in understanding, practical knowledge, longevity in memory - all without much effort and with the pleasant feeling of the success of learning, which will encourage you to learn more
	* full learning of a mathematical object is more than just understanding the core definition or theorem; it also includes :
		* understanding the motivation
		* knowing the most important applications
		* seeing different perspectives and knowing different formulations
		* very importantly : some forgetting and then revisiting ["the power of forgetting"]
* work through the proofs
	* one may be tempted to skip the proofs by the thought that it want only to apply the theorem and not finding similar theorems on its own
	* this is a big mistake in learning math
	* proofs deepen the understanding and memorization of the theorems, help practising the other math knowledge that is used in the proofs
	* try to prove yourself before reading the proof from a teacher
		* it is okay to give up, but try
		* during trying you will 
			* create a more precise, better understanding about the theorem itself
			* you will prepare your brain to understand the teacher's proof both psychically and technically
				* trying makes the thinker more curious about the solution
				* you are likely to get at least closer to a solution, with which understanding the full solution is easier
* understand > memorize
	* math needs more understanding and less memorizing than other kind of science
	* understanding is better in the early of the day
	* long time memorizing is better in the late of the day
	* though this advice is weaker than to follow your mood
* interwine brain activity
	* to maximize brain throughput : one may want to intertwine math learning with learning other kind of science - because math is very different : it uses somewhat different part of the brain
* do not force it
	* if after all you still do not like math, are not interested in it or do not have the mood for it then do not do it; then you would not be efficient in it anyway, beside stealing your own lifetime; life is short, spend it on what is important for you, chase your own curiosity, dreams, goals
