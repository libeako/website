* how to find multiplicative generators of a finite field Fp*
	* theorem used
		* if
			* p is prime, y is integer not divisable by p
			* y ^ n = 1 mod p
		* then
			* the n is multiple of the order of y mod p
	* assuming 
		* p and q are primes and q divides p-1
	* choose x in Fp*
	* y : = x ^ ((p-1)*q)
	* then y ^ q = 1 mod p
	* by the theorem above : q is multiple of the order of y 
	* q is prime, hence the order of y is either 1 [then y = 1 mod p] or q [because q is prime]
	* (x ^ ((p-1)*q) = 1 mod p) is easy to test
