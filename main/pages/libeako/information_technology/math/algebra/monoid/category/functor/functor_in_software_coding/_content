* the most important category in programming is the one whose objects are types and arrows are functions between those types; in this section by "functor" i mean a functor between such categories
* between such categories a functor is a pair of functions, (one from types to types) and (one from functions to functions)

* map "lift"s
	* intuitively : function 'map' "lift"s a function from the normal type level to the level of the container
* functor = content + context
