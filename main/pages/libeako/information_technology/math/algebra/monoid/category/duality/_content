* definition
	* for all categories : reversing all the arrows in it results in a category; the resultant category is named the "dual" of the original category
* dual is involution
	* which means that the dual of the dual is the original [for all category c : dual (dual c) = c]
		* => all categories are dual of some category
* the "duality principle"
	* is a theorem : if a proposition is true for all categories then the dual of the proposition [the same but the arrows reversed in it] is also true for all categories
		* the proof is trivial, based on the observation that all categories are dual of some category
* the significance of duality
	* all the results in category theory automatically have a dual version for free
	* 2 things from other territories that seem unrelated may turn out to have correspondents in category theory that are dual to each other; such turn out reveals structural "sameness" between those seemingly unrelated things, a bridge between them that can be used to copy results from any to the other
		* example
			* the product and sum types from programming
