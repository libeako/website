* the logical relation corresponding to functor s is easily spotted intuitively by thinking about functors as containers : 2 containers are equivalent iff their elements are equivalent; the element-wise connection is provided by the map function of the functor :
* (equiv (fx1 : F X1) (fx2 : F X2) by (f : X1 -> X2)) = (map f fx1 = fx2)
