* content
	* some parts of this website is chaotic, just a bunch of thoughts, references, ...
	* using 2 versions of each element of the alphabet ["small" and "capital"] is idiotic, in my opinion; in many situations i can not get away without adhereing to this habit, but at least i try to not use it to signal beginning of sentence
	* i use round brackets not to give additional information but for grouping, i use square brackets to give additional information
	* quality
		* making this site good is a strong intention of me, hence if you find any factual mistake or did not understand something [the math and programming stuff may be not easy at some points] or have suggestion then please let me know
