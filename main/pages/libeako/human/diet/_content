* slimming
	* benefits of getting slim
		* general health increase
			* blood pressure decrease
				* obesity increases blood pressure; blood pressure is often limited by drugs; but drugs usually have negative side effects and they are less reliable than getting slim
			* decrease of load on joints
				* the cartridges in our joints becomes thinner by time; simply by mechanical erosion; this is unavoidable; this effect often decreases life quality very significantly; the speed of erosion significantly depends on the weight that the joint holds
		* once you are over the slimming diet : you will be able to live as you do now [eat and burn with the same speed as now] but in a slimmer body
		* more appetite for moving
			* moving is more easy and pleasant in a slimmer body; this leads to a positive spiral
	* the basic recipe for slimming is very simple : maintain an energy deficit on the average
		* that implies that you should either decrease eating or increase moving; which one should you choose? as it is easy for you; i think that generally the most easy and healthy is to do both, that is : devide your effort in both directions instead of concentrating only to one of them; this is because the difficulty in both increases super-linearly
	* overeating is your primary enemy
		* avoiding overeating is much easier than undereating
		* refuse mom's next extra dish; i know : it is made with love, but you have to be tough in this, explain to her that this is and why is important for you
		* when you eat at a restaurant : make your left-over be packaged for you rather than force it into yourself; do not use you stomach as a container; i used to bring a plastic container with myself, and eat only half of the meal
	* pshyche
		* if you can not stand to not overeat yourself in the state of hunger then rather eat early in the day, becuase overeating before sedation is bad
		* the food that you want to eat now is not going to get lost if you do not eat it now; you can always eat it later; think about how much more pleasant a later consumption of it would be
		* it helped me much that i saw someone after 10 days of water-fasting in front of a table full with food and acting normally, calmly, i saw with my own eyes that even many days of fasting does not hurt; if he could do that then surely i should be able to at least decrease my eating
	* food matters
		* fat, carbohydrate, protein are the matters that the body uses as energy
		* protein primarily is not an energy source, but the body will use it as such if excess of it is available
		* fat contains 2 energy than carbohydrate or protein
		* avoid imbalances from carbohydrates
			* eat little, multiple times
			* mix different carbohydrates [with different glycemic index]
			* avoid sugar, especially added ones, especially fructose - they get into the blood very quickly
	* food types
		* be aware what food contains what
		* some foods contain surprisingly much energy, especially compared to their healthy matter content
			* generally fruits [for example apple, tomato] consists mostly of carbohydrate and contains very little healthy matter
			* beer
			* sugar is added to surprisingly many food products, for example fruity yogurts
	* but still eat
		* vitamins and minerals
			* it is okay to get them from artificial sources
			* be careful : the ones soluable in fat can be overeaten
		* animal protein
			* do not over eat it, because then the body converts the surplus to energy
			* sources
				* meat
				* diary
					* be aware : milk contains much energy due to its fat and lactose content; even the lactose content alone makes milk a high energy food type; lactose-free milk is usually sweetened by added sugar
					* the best is cheese with low fat content [25%]
				* egg
			* it is okay if you miss protein for some days, but make sure to to get sufficient amount on average
