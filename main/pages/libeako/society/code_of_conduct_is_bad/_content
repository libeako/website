* code of conduct is not necessary
	* do you need written laws to behave well? do you not know what is good behavior without having read it? it is not that good behavior depends on the project or on the team; it is enough to behave friendly or at least neutrally and everyone knows how to do that without written laws
* code of conduct harms
	* it can exclude net positive people from a project just to obey the law
	* it has to be read and remembered, which takes effort
* my attitude
	* a code of conduct would not be a showstopper for me but it would significantly deters me from participating; the existence of a code of conduct suggests to me that the team has the fetish of obeying laws, instead of work and leisure interaction
