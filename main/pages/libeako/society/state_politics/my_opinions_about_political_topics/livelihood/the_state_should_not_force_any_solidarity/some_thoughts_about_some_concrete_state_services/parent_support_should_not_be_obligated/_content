* children should not be forced to support their parents
* the support by the child should be earned, not forced
* the duty of the parent
	* concretely :
		* make children only if knows that it can give over good genes, personality
		* love the child
		* educate the child to become a good person
	* summed :
		* make the child to become a good adult
* it the parent holds up to these duties then the child will itself certainly want to support its parent; the child does not want to support its parent only if the parent was not good enough
* the will of the future child is an ideal judgement about the parenthood; much better then a state judge; the bad parent may play the nice person toward the outside of the family and abuse the child in the apartment; the childhood in such situation is nightmare, grown up the child wants to forget that parent; but such law forces the child to even work for the person; the law making exceptions about bad parents is not enough; forcing such child to prove the unprovable in front of a state court is bad
