* how much service could poor people afford themselves ?
	* the story should begin with the realization that they are the people who pay for the services anyway, via taxed, the state is a mediator; how much would the services cost if they were funded not via taxing but selling? its production cost, which equals to the average tax payed / human; hence the average taxpayer would not lose by moving the system from taxing to selling; but the majority of the people would [this is false, as you will see later]; but the story goes on; taxing carries significant extra cost; also : the state operates everything inefficiently; these 2 factors in my estimate make the state services 2-3 times more expensive; hence those people who pay 2-3 times less than the average tax would be effected neutrally by the state services getting stopped; that is almost everybody would be effected positively; and we still did not count with time; less taxing is better economy, which is significant factor in the long time, hence in the long time everyone wins by stopping the state services
