* forced equalization of success is also known as "shocialism", "leftist politics"; the state forcefully decreases the difference in the success level of people
* economy background
	* the explanation for forced equalization: the marginal usefulness of wealth is decreasing
		* that is : as the wealth grows - the additional personal usefulness of it decreases
		* this argument talks only about the usage of the wealth, and not about the creation of wealth; the equalization intends to maximize the short term well-being of the society
	* it is harmful in long time
		* because it decreases the total wealth and production of the economy

* it is very popular
	* because
		* most of the voters are not successful
		* the people do not see the economic consequences
	* the rulers practice it for the popularity
		* and not because of humanity; they constantly maintain the picture that the are humanitarian, they have big heart and feel with the poor, and "we have to help the poor", "we work for the poor"; it is all lie, they do it not because they feel for the poor, they feel for the votes
		* proof :
			* if rulers in developed, rich countries decreased the spending on old people's health then the saved money could be used to save multiple times higher number of young lives in poor countries; in rich countries much of the health care cost is spent to elongate sick people's life by 1 miserable year, while in the poorest countries children die by simple to treat diseases; the rules do not try to maximize the help for the poor, because they do not want to help the poor; they want to collect votes, and the families of the sick child in a foreign poor country do not give them votes
* equality in wealth is not a goal
	* a better goal is the general [or toatl] wealth of the society
	* examples
		* if you build a house for yourself then you become wealthier by that; if also i do not then the inequality got bigger; is that bad? ? ? no; it is not; because you became richer, not i poorer; i did not became poorer only because you became richer; even contrary : with this new asset [the house] existing perhaps we can make a voluntary exchange : i work for you and in exchange you allow me to live in your house
			* though shocialist politicians would probably portray such an exchange as "the heartless capitalist forces the poor homeless person into slavery"
		* if you work and save so that after your death your child inherits it, and also i do not do so then your child will start its life better than my one; it that bad? no; because you did not harm my child; even contrary : perhaps your child will use that capital to provide a better job opportunity to my child
		* if i invest my saving in high risk high reward fashion and you stay on the safe way and i get lucky then my gain will be larger than yours, i will be richer than you; is that bad? no; you was not harmed at all buy me getting richer
	* hopefully you can feel from the examples : wealth difference on its own is not a problem; and hence the [wealth or "opportunity" or "capability"] equality is a mistaken goal
* social justice
	* shocialists often say that [wealth] inequality is social injustice; but stated so is incorrect; becoming richer is injustice only if it happens by hurting other people's moral rights
* be honest
	* i just prooved that that forcing [wealth] equality works against the society; this proof is simple and understandable : but even its recognition and understanding is not necessary to choose the right way, that is to reject forcing equality; it would be enough to be honest, fair; more accurately : to comply with the "do not steal" command; because forcing equality is the forceful relocation of success from the more successful to the less successful, which is theft
* at least think for your descendants
	* if despite all my previous arguments you still support forcing [wealth] equality then consider that even if it makes your life better [probably not] : it makes your descendants' life worse, because the economy that they will live in will be worse
	* which is better life?
		* as relatively poor in a rich country
			* for example Switzerland
		* as relatively rich in a poor country
			* for example in North Korea, where richness is having enough rice to not starve
