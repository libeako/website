* quality protection is an important part of human civilization
* the main methods of it
	* reputation
		* firms are highly incentivised by the free market to maintain good reputation
		* most of the quality protection is done by the reputation mechanism in the sense that most exchange decisions are made based on the hope that the other party would not risk to lose reputation
	* certificate
		* this is usually applied in sectors in which the reputation mechanism does not work or is not enough
			* for example :
				* developing sectors where new firms arise frequently, or far abroad
					* for example :
						* web hosting
	* state
		* this and only this one is violent
		* it is also corrupt and inflexible
		* it should have never been applied on a market against competing businesses
			* this suggestion assumes that people would check each partner before considering an exchange with them; some people are afraid of this : "i would have to look for a badge at the door of the shop before i choose to shop in it?"; yes, but that is not a big difficulty; also : the need happens very rarely, because most of the times we just rely on the reputation method
