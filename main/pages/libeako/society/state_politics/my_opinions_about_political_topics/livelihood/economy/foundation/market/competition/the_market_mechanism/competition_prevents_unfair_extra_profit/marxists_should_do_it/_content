* often marxist politicians outcry that "profiteer businesses" make extra unfair profit by exploiting the little persons [employees or clients]
* i earlier explained how competition prevents unfair extra profit

* but here is an other argument too that proves them wrong:
* they could to it themselves; the exploitive activity; by setting the amount of exploitation to half of what the "profiteer businesses" do: they still make an extra profit, half of it, but still; they would make themselves rich; while also halving the amount of exploitation, by which: helping the exploited people
* i have never ever seen a marxist politician to do so, they never ever even think about it; why? because they actually know that if they count all the costs [the capital, the learning, the risk] of the business then it is not that good opportunity after all
	* risk is real cost too

* and they also know that this "exploitation" demagogy resonates in a substantial number of voters
