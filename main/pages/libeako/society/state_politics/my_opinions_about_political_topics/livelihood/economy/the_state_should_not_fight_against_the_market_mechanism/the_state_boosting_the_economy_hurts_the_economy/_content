* politicians all over the world like to "boost" the economy; that is good, eh? we all want ever greater economy; but really : it hurts the economy; the real reason of such activity is the corruption opportunity in it
* what wealth the state can give to the economy it must take it from the economy; just from this one can suspect that the state can not support the economy, only transfer wealth from the tax-payers to selected business agents
* beside the forceful state intervention's base effect being overall negative to the economy: they usually carry extra costs too: rent seeking, extra cost of taxing, corruption.

* an analogy
	* the state boost the economy so as a snake grows by eating it own tail
* some concrete method
	* providing capital for certain businesses is not the task of the state
		* good business plans do not need the state ti access capital
			* private capital likes to go to and even seek good investment opportunities
		* private investors are better in judging the profitability of business
			* the professional who handles its own wealth or someone's close to it [client, ...] is better motivated to do well then an officer
	* the state should not boost job creation
		* jobs are getting created by their own, as need is for them, the state only needs to allow it; the better question is their quality [wage, ...], but that is decreased by such state actions; because these incentivise the firms to employ more employees, to achieve their tasks with more employees, that is to decrease the work efficiency, which is proportional to the wage

		* such actions are often done by states that parallelly tax employment, work
			* that is taxing real, efficient work to boost fake work
	* the state should not "boost" the export
		# links-to internal vnonvimjjkplmmyrn
	* attracting foreign capital and know-how - not by coercing the domestic actors
		* the state should not give tax [or similar] advantage to foreign firms; this happens at the expense of the domestic ones, because they need to be taxed more to compensate and still compete with the foreigners for domestic economical resources like work, real estate
		* by this the state distorts the business word so that the firms are under foreign [advantages] ownership
	* "outbreak points"
		* political candidates like to promise that they will boost the economy much; because they do not want to promise something that really is good for the economy [decreasing encumbrance] [because that is unpopular] : they fabricate some vague fake method to boost the economy
		* one such is the "outbreak point"; for example; we will support the tourism and information technology industry into greate success and then they will pull the economy up
		* but such program is not an economic development, but popping up some sectors at the expense of the others, distorting the balance between the sectors, with high extra cost
			* link to how the free market mechanism leads to optimal balance betweenm the sectors
