* economical decisions are lead by prices; the price of the good signals the cost and usage value of the good; the usage value for a good are signaled toward the suppliers by the price to optimize its supplied quantity; the cost of a good is signaled toward the consumers to optimize its usage
* the price of a good signals its overall cost, however complex its production is; the price of potato contains the cost of the soil, which contains the cost of manure, which contains the cost of livestock, which contains the cost of hutch, which contains the cost of wood, which contains the cost truck helping in its production, and so on infinitely; even cycle may be in the graph of such dependencies, the market mechanism handles that without any problem; and for all dependencies : only the relevant part of it is counted into the derived good; for example : the cost of milk may be smaller than the cost of cows, because the cows are used for other purposes [meat, manure] than milk too
* human can not oversee the infinitely complex dependencies between the different goods in the economy; fortunately does not have to; it is enough that every person oversees the usage values | costs of the goods that that person is directly in contact with - and exactly this is what the price conveys; the price leads the persons [as an "invisible hand"] to economic decisions that are optimal for the whole economy
