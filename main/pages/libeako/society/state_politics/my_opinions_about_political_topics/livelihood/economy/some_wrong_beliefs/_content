* "consumption helps the economy"
	* the incorrect argument :
		* consumption gows => firms have more income => firms produce more => the economy grows.
	* the mistake in the argument is an application of the effect graph reduction; the truth is the opposite; what is missing from the incorrect argument is that for the increase in consumption some of the final amount of the resources of the economy are moved from the other type of economic activity, investment, which really is the foundation of economic growth

* "deflation is dangerous for the economy"
	* the incorrect story :
		* when prices decrease then people postpone their purchases in the expectation that they will be able to do those purchases later cheaper; thus current consumption falls, hence the economy shrinks
	* this story contains these thought mistakes :
		* the consumption falling does not cause the economy to shrink; the economy consists not only of consumption, but also of investment
		* people's sensitivity in price development is very low; they will postpone very little of their purchases; not only they do not postpone to buy the newest, unnecessary mobile phone for a year to save 2%, but they are ready to buy it with credit, paying 10% interest for a product that loses its market value by 20% / year on average
* "if something is done by the majority of the states then it is probably good"
	* but what the state does is not surely good for the country, but perhaps is good for the ruler personally; and that rulers act in their personal interest is a general phenomenon
	* a good example is the debt of the state; most countries are accumulating debt, and reached about (6 year of economic performance) on average; even the most developed, politically most free and responsible ones; that is obviously bad for the country but is good for the ruler personally, as its interest is to spend so much as possible without care about the future
* "the foreign firms should not take out the profit from our country"
	* then why would they risk to invest in your country?
	* it is their profit
		* they achieved it, it is the compensation of their contributions
