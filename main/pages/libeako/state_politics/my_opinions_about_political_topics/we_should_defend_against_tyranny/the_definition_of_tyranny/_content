* the biggest danger in politics is the following vicious circle : the ruler abuses its state power to fix itself personally inside the state
* reason
	* this is vicious mainly because in order to get rid of the ruler : it should stop being the ruler
	* an other reason is that the ruler is very motivated to stay the ruler
		* this is because
			* the state power gives pleasant feeling [which is addictive] and much personal wealth via corruption
			* the already performed abusing of state power would cause a jail sentence in case of losing the power
* totality is not necessary
	* a very important note is that totality of power is not necessary for this
	* there is a very wide spread misbelief among the people that a regime must be total in order to have reason to be afraid; many people think that no need is to worry if some obvious distinctive characteristics of totalitarian regimes are missing [for example : if the negative criticizing of the ruler is still mostly allowed] not seeing that plenty of other, less obvious tools are in the hand of the ruler to fix itself in its ruling position
	* the people not understanding this is the reason of the high number of partial tyrannies today; sneaky regimes cloak themselves as if the people were still in control, to keep the people asleep
	* but the vicious circle works partially too; and it is dangerous in partial implementation too; much less dangerous than a totalitarian regime, but still very dangerous; even by itself, and also as a stepping stone to getting deeper
	* in fact : almost all tyrannical regimes currently are partial
* naming
	* "dictatorship"
		* i do not like this word because 
			* according to Wikipedia : this word comes from latin and means a judge who got "absolute" state power temporarily
				* but :
					* "absolute" sounds like total
						* which [as i already explained] is not a necessary trait of the danger that i am discussing here
					* it was temporary
						* but one of the most core characteristic of the danger that i am discussing here is it being permanent
					* it was not the highest position in the state
			* even if we assume that it stems from something "to dictate" :
				* it is not a good fit, because dictating happens also in other relations, which are not dangerous [for example : in the employee-employer relation]
	* "authoritarian"
		* even wikipedia is ambiguous about it, mentioning both of these : 
			* something like statism
				* but that does not necessarily involve capturing the state for personal goals [at least not theoretically]
			* lack of competitiveness among the ruler candidates
				* which is too broad
					* for example : some candidate being able to raise less money for campaigning can also be interpreted so, but that situation is not part of the vicious circle [the opposing candidate may be the one who gets more money]
	* "tyrant"
		* according to wikipedia this comes from an ancient word meaning illegitimate ruler
			* i feel that this is the closest to the danger that i am describing here
* quantity of tyranny
	* according to this definition [the ruler abuses its state power to fix its personal position inside the state] - tyranny is not 2-valued [either zero or total], but any value is possible between the 2 extremes; but then : from which point can we legitimately use the word "tyranny" for a regime? i think that the cross-over is continuous; but there is one important milestone, above which we surely can legitimately use the word "tyranny " : when the ruler could not win an election without abusing the ruling power it already has
