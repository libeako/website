* why is it bad if votes get lost
	* the danger of potentially losing its vote pushes the voter to change its vote from the candidate most acceptable to it to a more popular candidate; by the voter selecting not the candidate most acceptable to it : the accuracy of the election decreases
	* vicious circle for the less popular candidates
		* those votes get lost that are given for loser candidates, that is for the not popular ones; hence voters are afraid to give their vote for them; this decreases their chance further [unfairly]; due to their chance being low : the media covers too little of them, less than proportional; this decreases their change yet further [unfairly]
	* the media and pollsters gain the harmful power
		* voter will prefer popular candidates, but how do they know which candidates are popular? the media and pollsters tell them; whoever the media and pollsters present as popular candidates will be preferred by the voters, hence will be popular by votes; thus the media and pollsters "preselect" the candidates
	* undermines the ide of democracy [ruling by majority]
		* winning election [and thus the ruling] becomes possible even against the will of the majority of the voters; theoretically : if the number of candidates is n then even getting only (1/n + 1) votes may be enough to win the election; just by winning the most count of votes; even if all the other voters see this most candidate as the worst
			* for modern tyrannies this is one of their most important tools; to use this tool: it is enough to oppress or devide the most important opposition party, which usually is easy for a tyran
	* the voters have to think about [estimate] the popularity of the individual candidates; this takes brain capacity, from other political topics, hence decreasing the already very low level of understanding of politics by the average voter, decreasing the quality of the election outcome
* losing votes could be avoided easily
	* votes getting lost can be avoided by a simple improvement in the election system : voters would vote not for candidates but for orders of candidates, that would be chosen and represented by the candidates; each candidate would report an order of the candidates to the election office; the election office would publish these orders at least 1 week before the election
	* a possible continuation of the winner selection is to have score for each position in the order and sum the scores weighted of course by the number of votes of the orders
	* note that this method units the advantages of the single vote and the preferential voting systems; the voter does a single vote, as used to and no vote gets lost
* most applied methods to make votes lost are :
	* these methods do not have any honest reason; they are always tools of tyranny
