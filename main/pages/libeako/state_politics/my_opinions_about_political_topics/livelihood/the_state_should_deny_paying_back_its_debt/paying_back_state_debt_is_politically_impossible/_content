* an example
	* let us suppose that a sustainable level of gifts for the poor is 10 dollars / some time; this would be raised by a populist [that is almost any] ruler to 12 by borrowing 2; to stop increasing the debt an honest ruler would have to set the gift back to 10, which the poor would consider unacceptable; they would not see the populism and honesty, but that the populist ruler loves them and the honest one is bad handler of money and wants to compensate bad management at the expense of the poor; but the situation is even worse : the gift would have to be set back not to 10, but to 8 for a while to pay back the dept
* an average ruler will make so much dept as it can; an honest ruler paying back the debt has no sense because sooner or later a dishonest ruler would grow the debt again; fighting the debt by paying it back would be politically very difficult even if dishonest ruling was rare; but the reality is that what is rare is honest ruling
