* copyright is much less bad than patents; because unlike patents : copyright does not constrain independent work
* the negative side of copyright
	* but copyright is also very bad; it does its harm [like patents] by constraining fair activities too, that is activities which are not unfair usage of someone else's work
		* requires serious knowledge of the law from creators
			* many copyright licenses exist; in order a creator to be able to choose a suitable one : has to learn and understand a lot from copyright law; this is a difficult task even if the creator intends to totally free the created intellectual product; even in this case : has to select from many possibilities, the difference between which can matter

		* makes combination difficult
			* nowadays most intellectual work is built on already existing other work; if the different pieces have different licenses than the legal situation of the combination is difficult; sometimes conflicts are between the licenses of the pieces, which prevents their combination
			* creating intellectual products many people cooperating over the internet is usual already; everyone prepares its own piece, sends it to the project leader with copyright license; for example the most important software are created like this; how can the project leader know that the sender really is the owner of the piece it sent? because otherwise the usage of the piece is prohibited by the copyright law; it can not be known, thus the projects are always under the risk of non-intentional copyright infringement; even if in an infringement case the punishment can be avoided : surely the infringing piece must surely be cut out, which may be difficult to do technically and the usage and distribution of the whole product is obstructed
			* sometime the license of the whole product must be changed due to legal technicalities; but if the number of authors is big then it may be difficult or impossible to find all of them and convince them to agree to the change; some may be unknown in the real world [they work anonymously], some may have died, ...; this can easily jeopardize the developement of the whole product
* the positive side of the copyright is overvalued
	* many intellectual products are declared to be free by their authors; the reasons of such act may be :
		* the author loves its creation, want it to be used by many
		* for fame
		* for sympathy
		* for professional recognition
		* this is a method of advertising
		* real good will for the world
	* creators can get significant income from their intellectual work without copyright too; for example through concert, advertisement, teaching, support, certification
	* but the creation of intellectual product would not stop even without copyright
		* this is already prooved by the existance of many intellectual property not supported [even obstructed] by copyright
			* examples :
				* the most important software are already free [this website is also created using only free software]
				* Wikipedia prooved that high quality awesome educational material is created without compensation and even without fame, advertisement, acknowledgement
		* real artistic value comes only from passion, not from expectation of compensation
* other sources
