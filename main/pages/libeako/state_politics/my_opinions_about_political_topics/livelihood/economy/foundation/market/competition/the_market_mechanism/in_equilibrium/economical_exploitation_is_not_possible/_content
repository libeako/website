* many people think that the big economical actors may exploit the smaller ones, like ordinary people, as employees and end-consumers; this is false; a big and important mistake in belief; exploitation is not possible by a side of market with competition; because competitive participants do not themselves control the prices [even if they are big], but that is necessarily equal to the marginal cost and usage value of the traded good
	* exploitation is not possible through quality either, because the competition forces the price to fit the quality
