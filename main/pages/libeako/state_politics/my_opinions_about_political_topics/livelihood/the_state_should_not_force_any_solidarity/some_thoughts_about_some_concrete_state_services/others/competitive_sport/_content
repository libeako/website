* competitive sport is not useful
* it is not enough excuse that it is a source of proud for the country or nation
	* proudness should not be a goal
	* but even if it is then that some of us can run fast is not a reason to be proud; a persons ability to run very fast does not help anyone; we rather should be proud about our useful results than the exceptional ones
