* one especially bad, but now [2019] very common shocialist method to help people y is to force people who help y to help even more; this is crazy because what usually happens is unsurprisingly that this works as a punishment of the helper for helping and hence the helpers get frightened away from helping y and hence y instead of getting more help gets no help at all
* examples
	* if x lends an apartment to y and y becomes pregnant then to protect the baby, x loses its right to get rid of y; as result apartment owners become not willing to lend to women who have or may in the future have children
	* all "protection"s against economic exploitation in markets with competition
