* amnesty international is scam
	* travel warning against USA because of guns
		* Amnesty International issued a travel warning against going into the USA; with the form of real, serious travel warnings, with 3 big exclamation marks; no sign of any statement of it being a joke; they are serious; they say that it is dangerous to be in the USA because of "high level of gun violence"
			* some remaining of that travel warning

		* i quote from the text : "have an emergency contingency plan" [despite they obviously do not help at all against isolated cases of gun violence], "be extra vigilant at all times" [one can not be extra vigilent at all times even in war-zones], "avoid places where large number of people gather" [those stupid locals gather only because they are not well informed about the threat level], "excercise increased caution when visiting local bars, nightclubs, and casinos." [how will caution save anybody from gun violence? how can one enjoy these places [that are meant built to be enjoyed] if increased caution is necessary visiting them?]
		* they portray the USA as if it was more dangerous than the front line in the second world war; which is obviously false; not only is USA not a war-zone, but gun violence is not even a particularly big danger : even suicide is a statistically more probably cause of death than gun homocide.
		* they say that the threat is discriminating according to gender identity, country of origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation and that travellers should study the particular threat level of their groups before travelling into the USA
		* about 1/4 part of the text is pure politics, which does not give any rational information, but just is demagogue - in a text that is said to be a travel warning; in case if you still had any naive thought about the goal of this text from them
		* with this behavior AI downplays not only its seriousness, but also the seriousness of travel warnings generally, causing people to underestimate real dangers and thus possibly causing even their death - just to give one more hard punch to gun-allowing politics
		* other article s from them also contain in my opinion lots of lying, bias and demagogy. For example they say that the gun violence in the USA is a crysis
			* this is such an article
