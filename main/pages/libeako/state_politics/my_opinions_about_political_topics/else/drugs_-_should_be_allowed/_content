* the posession, consumption should be allowed
	* the law against possession is a weapon against anyone
		* the attacker needs just to hide drug in the apartment or car or suitcase of the victim and then anonymously "inform" the police to search for it
		* police itself may hide the drug before finding it
	* police can freely molest people with the excuse "i felt weed"
	* the prohibition of possession and consumption frightens away friends of the consumers, because they do not want to get near illegal activity; this hurts the addicts because they need their friends much; without companion the addicts get depressed and hence even more into the drug
* supply [production and distribution] should also be allowed
	* this is the interest of the consumers
		* in case of prohibition of supply the composition is 
			* unknown
				* even the material coming from the same source is changing
				* overdosing happens often
			* unreliable
				* brands can not arise
			* often [very] poisonous
		* if the supply was legal than the consumers could get the material in pharmacies, cheaply, with guaranteed cleanness and precise, accurate description
* a nice compromise :
	* extra-tax instead of totally prohibit
