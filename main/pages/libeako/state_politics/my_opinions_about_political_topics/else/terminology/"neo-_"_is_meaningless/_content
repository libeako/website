* i mean the "neo" prefix in names of political directions; as in "neo-fascist", "neo-natzi", "neo-liberal"; "neo" means new, simply; this prefix is meaningless; because political directions do not depend on time, they do not change; their strength in the society, opinions about them and even their names may change, but not the directions themselves; they are principles, moral theories => they are constant in time
* if the [original] liberal and the neo liberal directions are not the same then one of them is not really liberal; for that one: neither "liberal" nor "neo-liberal" is a good name
