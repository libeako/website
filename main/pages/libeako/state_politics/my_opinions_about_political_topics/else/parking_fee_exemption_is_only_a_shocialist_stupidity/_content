* the parking fee exemption for the local car users is and only is a shocialist stupidity
* the parking fee income is a very good type of income for the state, because it does not require aggression and does not distort prices; even contrary : the exemption distorts the prices [of parking]; the accuracy of parking prices is important in order the people to make correct decision when deciding whether to use a car; in this decisions they should fully count the cost of the parking place
* from locality the right for the parking place does not come; in the past the parking was free of charge because then the number of cars was so low that the parking space was not scarce, and not because a right for the parking came with the apartment
* summery : the shocialist parking fee exemption has the following negatives :
	* the state loses a good income source, that has to be replaced with a worse one
	* the price of parking gets distorted
		* the distribution of the parking space among its potential users gets suboptimal
		* the congestion gets suboptimally big
