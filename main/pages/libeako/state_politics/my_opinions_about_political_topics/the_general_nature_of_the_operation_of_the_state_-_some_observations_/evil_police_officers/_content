* some people are evil
	* or something like that, more or less
	* example :
		* youtube star uploads video about her disciplining her dog.
			* link
				# links-to external https://youtu.be/V26p0vg_GLQ
			* her reason for the discipline is that the dog expresses love to her; in my opinion that shows a sick soul; then the dog forgives and shows love again; the owner should be grateful for such a loving dog; but she punishes the dog again; and then again
			* she stands in front of the dog, knowing the dog is in playful mood, then acts as she was talking to a human, knowing that her opening her arms will be interpreted by the dog as invitation to jump; she knows the dog will jump on her, as an act of play; she still uses it as an excuse to punish
			* imagine what should would do as a police officer to an innocent but unknown to her person, if she does this to a soul that loves her and is loyal to her much
			* even with body cameras on we see a lot of cases in which the officer could not resist its urge to escalate the situation
* police attracts them
	* police as a profession is a wonderful environment for people who like to intimidate, humiliate, feel power, hurt, giving them legal and practical power to that; and hence often evil people will seak to become a police officer
* this is one important reason why police and hence the state is expensive and dangerous
