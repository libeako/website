* the state is exactly the right for aggression
* that is : the state is not more and not less than the right for aggression
* not more
	* the sate does not do anything without aggression
		* for example : it uses spending for almost everything, but the wealth it spends is from taxation, most [perhaps all] of which is aggressive theft
		* if the sate would do anything without its right for aggression then it would not have any competitive advantage relatively to the private competitors in that activity, but it would have a disadvantage : the inefficiency of the state generally [which is due to the inaccuracy of the incentives of its employees]; hence the state would be not competitive overall; hence could not maintain the activity without aggression
		* hence the state does not and can not do anything without aggression
