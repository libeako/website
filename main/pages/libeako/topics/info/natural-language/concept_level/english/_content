* last -> previous
	* unfortunately  many people has the bad habit to use "last" when they mean "previous"
	* they differ
	* if more instances of the kind of event in discourse will happen then the previous one was not the last one
	* the correct schema
		* first
		* ...
		* previous
		* current
		* next
		* ...
		* last
* { she he } -> { it }
	* the gender is
		* rarely important
		* usually determined by the context
		* often not known
	* no real wrong exists with the neutral "it"
* there is -> exists
	* "there" is a specification of location
		* it is dual of "here"
	* we should not use "there"
		* at least when we do not really intend to specify the location
		* when we specify the location strictly more precisely anyway
			* example
				* "there is meal in the fridge"
		* in these cases "exists" is a good alternative
* dependency -> { dependendee, depender }

* hack -> crack
	* "hacking" is just coding, putting together something practical from pieces, it is not breaking some security system; use "crack" for that perhaps
* 'of' -> 'that is'
	* example of incorrect usage: 'city of Budapest', 'distance of 5 meter'
		* these are incorrect, as
			* Budapest does not have a city; Budapest is a city
			* 5 meter do not have a distance, it is a distance
		* the correct phrase would is - 'city that is Budapest', 'distance that is 5 meter'
* 'rate' -> 'speed'
	* people often say 'rate' when they mean spead; this is correct, but more specific is better; when the rate that you mean is spead [when its denominator is time] then it is good to use 'speed'
