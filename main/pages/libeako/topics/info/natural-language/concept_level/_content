* the language we use is highly effected by common habits; once a habit is born - in practice it is difficult to get rid of it, even if it is wrong
* please say truth, this is important
* it is not okay to have mistakes in expressing yourselve just because your communication partners also have the same mistakes and hence you are in consistency with them; you should be consistent with truth too, not only with your partners; this is important
	* a mistake in our language being common habit is a reason not to let it live and go along with it but to opposite it even more, as it is even more dangerous
* changing a common habit in any interface [like language] is very difficult, even when it is a wrong habit
	* i know this from my experience
		* people even get really mad at me just for trying
		* it sometimes makes others not understand me, hence they may think i am stupid and turn away from me and hence my ability to spread my good thoughts get diminished
* be a hero, revolt against incorrectnesses
* this wrong attitude of the common people is somewhat an example of
	* common stupidity

* concrete cases
	* quantity unit
		* "measurement unit" -> "quantity unit"
			* a quantity type is not 'measured in a unit' but concrete quantities are 'expressed with' a unit
			* the measurement is an act or a process, it obtains concrete quantities as information; once the quantity is known in some unit: it is also known in all other units of that quantity type; the conversion between units is just a simple multiplication; thus the measurement is not bound to a unit; units are for expressing concrete quantities
				* whether those concrete quantities come from an earlier measurement or not
					* they do not have to, they can be made up, like [for example] examples
			* it is not the quantity type that is measured but concrete quantities
		* quantity type, unit of quantity type
			* they are distinct notions and neither of them is a special of the other; thus replacing one with the other is never valid
			* unfortunately a lot of people has the bad habbit to use its unit instead of the quantity type
			* here are the corrections in some common instances of mistakes of this type
				* "milage" -> distance
				* "tonnage" -> mass
			* units are for expressing concrete quantitities; they are not good for anything else; thus the usages other than expressing concrete quantities are incorrect
		* / unit quantity
			* the word unit is erroneously said for the denominator
			* suppose x, y are types of quantities; people often say that their ratio is "x / unit y"; why the "unit" in it?
	* "mean" -> "imply"
		* "what does the outcome of the election mean for the automotive industry"?
		* in the above example the word "mean" is incorrectly used; should be "imply" or "cause"
		* only symbols can mean something
	* "electronic" -> "digital"
		* they are distinct notions and neither of them is a special of the other; thus replacing one with the other is never valid
		* unfortunately most people has the bad habit to use "electronic" when they mean "digital"
			* for example "email" is a usually incorrect term
				* because the underlying physical implementation
					* is not intended to refer to
					* is not even totally electronic
						* a large part of current digital mailing is optical or magnetic
	* "{ left | right } hand side"
		* "hand" is irrelevant here
	* a "telephone number" is not a number
		* it is just an identifier
		* a number expresses quantity
		* it is only a tradition to use only digits in the identifier text
		* hence please use "telephone identifier" or "tel id" for short instead of "telephone number"
		* the story is the same with "car number plates"
	* "hard" -> "difficult"
		* as you do not say "soft" instead of "easy" either
	* non-commutative infix binary functions - their symbol should indicate direction

	* "model" -> "type"
		* it became a habit, incorrectly, to say "model" instead of "type"
			* examples
				* Tesla Model Y
					* in this name "type" should be instead of "model"
					* model is just the files that are used only internally the firm to guide manufacturing, these files, the model tell the manufacturing deparments what exactly to manufacture; when you buy a car you 'buy a car with a type', or slightly distortedly you 'buy a type of car', but you surely do not buy a model, as you surely do not need and do not want a model, as you are not going to manufacture a car instance by it
