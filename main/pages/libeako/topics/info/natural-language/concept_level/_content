* the language we use is highly effected by common habits; once a habit is born - in practice it is difficult to get rid of it, even if it is wrong
* please say truth, this is important
* it is not okay to have mistakes in expressing yourselve just because your communication partners also have the same mistakes and hence you are in consistency with them; you should be consistent with truth too, not only with your partners; this is important
	* a mistake in our language being common habit is a reason not to let it live and go along with it but to opposite it even more, as it is even more dangerous
* changing a common habit in any interface [like language] is very difficult, even when it is a wrong habit
	* i know this from my experience
		* people even get really mad at me just for trying
		* it sometimes makes others not understand me, hence they may think i am stupid and turn away from me and hence my ability to spread my good thoughts get diminished
* be a hero, revolt against incorrectnesses
* this wrong attitude of the common people is somewhat an example of
	* common stupidity

* concrete cases
	* quantity unit
		* "measurement unit" -> "quantity unit"
			* a quantity type is not 'measured in a unit' but concrete quantities are 'expressed with' a unit
			* the measurement is an act or a process, it obtains concrete quantities as information; once the quantity is known in some unit: it is also known in all other units of that quantity type; the conversion between units is just a simple multiplication; thus the measurement is not bound to a unit; units are for expressing concrete quantities
				* whether those concrete quantities come from an earlier measurement or not
					* they do not have to, they can be made up, like [for example] examples
			* it is not the quantity type that is measured but concrete quantities
		* quantity type, unit of quantity type
			* they are distinct notions and neither of them is a special of the other; thus replacing one with the other is never valid
			* unfortunately a lot of people has the bad habbit to use its unit instead of the quantity type
			* here are the corrections in some common instances of mistakes of this type
				* "milage" -> distance
				* "tonnage" -> mass
			* units are for expressing concrete quantitities; they are not good for anything else; thus the usages other than expressing concrete quantities are incorrect
		* / unit quantity
			* the word unit is erroneously said for the denominator
			* suppose x, y are types of quantities; people often say that their ratio is "x / unit y"; why the "unit" in it?
	* "mean" -> "imply"
		* "what does the outcome of the election mean for the automotive industry"?
		* in the above example the word "mean" is incorrectly used; should be "imply" or "cause"
		* only symbols can mean something
	* "electronic" -> "digital"
		* they are distinct notions and neither of them is a special of the other; thus replacing one with the other is never valid
		* unfortunately most people has the bad habit to use "electronic" when they mean "digital"
			* for example "email" is a usually incorrect term
				* because the underlying physical implementation
					* is not intended to refer to
					* is not even totally electronic
						* a large part of current digital mailing is optical or magnetic
	* "{ left | right } hand side"
		* "hand" is irrelevant here
	* a "telephone number" is not a number
		* it is just an identifier
		* a number expresses quantity
		* it is only a tradition to use only digits in the identifier text
		* hence please use "telephone identifier" or "tel id" for short instead of "telephone number"
		* the story is the same with "car number plates"
	* "hard" -> "difficult"
		* as you do not say "soft" instead of "easy" either
	* "called" -> "named"
		* do you really think that things like mathematical concepts, physical phenomena, ... are called? do they ever come to us if we call them? if not then why would we keep calling them?
	* non-commutative infix binary functions - their symbol should indicate direction

	* "model" -> "type"
		* it became a habit, incorrectly, to say "model" instead of "type"
			* examples
				* Tesla Model Y
					* in this name "type" should be instead of "model"
					* model is just the files that are used only internally the firm to guide manufacturing, these files, the model tell the manufacturing deparments what exactly to manufacture; when you buy a car you 'buy a car with a type', or slightly distortedly you 'buy a type of car', but you surely do not buy a model, as you surely do not need and do not want a model, as you are not going to manufacture a car instance by it
