* english
	* postfix "s" at end of verb (in singular 3rd person)
		* is unnecessary
		* is inconsistent with the other cases
			* singularity and subject
				* singularity
					* single
					* plural
				* subject
					* i
					* you
					* it
				* these are conceptually independent dimensions and hence should be treated such
					* the s postfix [singular, 3 person] break this rule
			* 3 subject cases exist - why only 1 of them is distinguished from the other 2? what is the difference between it and the rest that is false to the other 2?; nothing
	* past tense as hypothesis
		* example
			* "if i was rich then i would not have to work"
		* is bad idea
			* because past tense and hypothesis are not related at all
		* (simply using "would" in the hypthesis part too) is more sensible
* in writing
	* the {small, big} character difference
		* is unnecessary
		* its only purpose is to visualize the start of a sentence, but that can be done more simple and economically by a special sentence starting letter
			* the following example sentence proves that capital letter usage is a conceptually bad way to visualize sentence start : "[some not essential detail] in a  gib sentence"; the previous sentence contains a some not essential detail as its beginning; where do you apply capitalization?; in the detail or in the rest?; both feels weird
		* causes errors
			* for example in
				* passwords
				* file paths
					* including URLs
		* requires convention
