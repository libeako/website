* some usual mistakes
	* specials
		* "special"s in gaming are temporary increases in incentives to play during a time interval, sometimes in special ways; for example by giving higher amount of in-game money or special gifts that can not be got otherwise
		* players will want to get those; the problem is : even when they are not in the mood for playing or not in the way that the special incentivises; they will do it for the benefit of their future playing; thus they will do it as a task; thus the gaming turns into work; that kills enthusiasm for the game, burns the player out
		* why then are these specials hold ? i can not imagine any good reason
	* too large content
		* the content [scenes, unit types] have to be learned by the players to be competitive; this is lexical learning, which is not fun, not playful, not entertainment
* revenue ideas
	* justice system
		* operate a system that accepts complaints from players against the behaviors of other players, usually teammates, punishes the behavior when it is found to be wrong; the accuser player pays for this justice service
