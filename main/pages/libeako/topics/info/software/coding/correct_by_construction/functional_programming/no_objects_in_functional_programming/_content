* the 'object' is an imperative concept
	* values are stored at memory locations; a value can be stored at multiple memory locations; a memory location can store only one value; an object is a value together with the memory location it is stored at; in semantics the memory location is relevant only if the value may get changed [using memory location as an identifier is a bad idea]; functional programming avoids mutation, hence the memory location in functional programming is irrelevant [and hence good functional programming languages normally do not even allow to query or compare the memory locations]
