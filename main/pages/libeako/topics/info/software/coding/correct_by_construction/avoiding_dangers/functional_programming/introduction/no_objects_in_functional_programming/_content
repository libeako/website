* values are stored at memory locations; a value can be stored at multiple memory locations; a memory location can store only one value; an object is a value together with the memory location it is stored at; in semantics the memory location is relevant only if the value may get changed; in functional programming no mutation exists, hence the memory location in functional programming is irrelevant [and hence good functional programming languages normally do not even allow to query and compare the memory locations], hence objects in functional programming do not exist like they do in object-oriented programming
