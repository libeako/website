* value that perhaps do not exist should be represented by an "optional type", which is usually named "Option" or rather "Maybe"; this is better solution than the null value

* exceptional return ["exceptions"]
	* it is usually a good practice to leave this language feature for operational-like errors, like out-of-memory, division-by-zero and not use it to react to exceptionality of input; for the latter case consider using instead an "Either" type modifier on the output
	* propagating exceptional value through function call stacks is much easier than most coders think - with smal functions that help to bubble up the exception, like the 'sequence' method of the "Applicative" interface
