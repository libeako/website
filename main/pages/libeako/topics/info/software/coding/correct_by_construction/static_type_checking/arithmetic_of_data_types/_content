* the names of the 2 type composing functions in adts [product, sum] have names like in arithmetic
* this is founded on a homomorphism from (the algebra of types with product and sum type construction) to (the algebra of non-negative integers with product and sum functions); this homomorphism is the size function that maps to a type t the number of values of t
	* in more earthy language
		* by "size" of a type t i will mean the number of values of t
		* the size of a product type is the product of the sizes of types of its members
		* the size of a sum type is the sum of the sizes of the types of its members
