* the dark age
	* when the 2 worlds [industry, academy] were almost totally separate:
	* academy
		* Fortran was the first language with a serious compiler; only one year after Fortran's appearance [which happened in 1957] the Lisp programming language appeared, which later became suitable for functional programming; this was the point [almost at the beginning of coding] when industry and academy parted: Fortran was used both of them, Lisp already was used mostly by academy
		* in the 1970s the programming language ML appeared, which was designed to be functional and have a good type system
		* the academy world strengthened its belief and presence in the functional programming and in the 1980s it turned towards purely functional programming, which excludes side-effects from the programming language semantics
		* this change process ended in the creation of the Haskell programming language
		* yet an other topic in which the academy achieved very noteworthy results is code abstractions
			* the key in the success was the utilization of mathematics, mostly category theory
			* most of this development happened in Haskell
		* beside functional programming: the other big topic of the academy is static type systems, and the academy achieved much good in it; the current state of the art is that type systems should be built on a core named "calculus of constructions", which is very powerful and simple and natural; which is very powerful and simple and natural
	* industry
		* some major industry languages were Fortran, C, C++, Java, C#, Python
		* they all were imperative, and the later ones are all "object-oriented"
			* object orientation is bad

		* C and especially Fortran are very early languages and their design were also loaded with the requirement to be very fast and easy to implement; i think they are good enough for their time and purpose
		* but C++, Java, C#, Python are from the 1990s, when the academy languages have already proved how to do much better; the designs of these industry languages are very amature works for their time; their designers seemingly did not even look in the academy world of language theory, which was more than 20 years ahead of them; these industry languages are used very widely; not because the [non-existent] merits in their design, but because some other, practical reasons
* C# became the latest popular programming language that totally neglected academy; hence i consider it the top of the industrial idiotism in programming language design
* the gap shrinking
	* C# started around 2000
	* soon after that the industry turned and the enlightment of the industry began, the industry turn toward academy
		* the turning point is marked by 2 programming languages: F#, Scala; their concept is the same: good programming platforms exist [Java, .Net], but their languages are bad, let us create better languages for these platforms; and better was more like academic: these new languages were both more functional and had stronger static type systems than their idiotic predecessors [Java, C#]
	* since that turning point the industry languages are slowly continuing what Scala and F# started
	* the change in the industry's attitude towards academy is not only still happening, but already some little signs are visible of that the gap may be getting closed
		* as witness of this statement: 1 langauge is to note: Lean
			* it is designed and implemented by Microsoft
			* it is designed for general purpose, it is purely functional with modern, very powerful type system [calculus of constructions]
