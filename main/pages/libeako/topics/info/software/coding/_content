* program coding is a part of programming; it is different from algorithms, project management, testing; it is part of "software engineering"; it is my hobby
* since i had the possibility for the first time to access a computer: i was fond of software coding; only of coding; hence i will write here mostly about coding; i am and always was interested about how the coding process could be more safe, efficient [paradigms, languages, abstractions, libraries, tools]
