* "Type Driven Development with Idris" by Edwin Brady
	* i did not like this book; i could not read it totally, only parts; because i found it boring and bad time / info value; my problem with it was that i found myself lost in the examples, while missing firm explanations of concepts; but perhaps this same property makes it a good candidate for beginners; the book explains even basic functional programming concepts and syntax; then goes on with dependent types, totality checking, ... ; i think programmers who have not yet any knowledge in these topics may try the book
