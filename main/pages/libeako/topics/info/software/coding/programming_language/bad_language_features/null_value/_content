* incorporating exceptional values into the types
	* is normally a bad practice

* the null value lifts this bad idea to the language level, not only giving support for it but fixing the poisoning of all types with null
* i advise to normally use optional type instead of the 'null' value; even in programming languages that contain null, one should adopt the practise to almost never use it; just pretend that the value set of type T does not contain null, and make this a convention
* all popular programming languages contain null
* its inventor, Tony Hoare said
	* "I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years."
