* optics are very useful in the everyday coding work; but despite this: most programmers do not know the topic; this tutorial is for them
* optics represent some categorically composable relationship between a collection and elements of it
* we can use an optic from a collection to "zoom in" on its elements and from the content to "zoom out" on the collection; hence the name "optic"
* for the pieces of data that an optic connects i may use the names ("content", "element") [("con", "elem") shortly] [("c", "e") more shortly]
	* an other common choice is ("inner", "outer"), but i do not like this because it does not convey containment which is strong part of the optic concept
* intuitive introduction

* one may view the container and content types as levels of data that the optics connect; hence i may use the "l1" = "content", "l2" = "container" short notations
* the most important characteristic and usefulness of optics is their categorical composability
	* see category

	* several categories [kinds] of optics exist; for each category: the optics inside the category compose with each other
* the concrete representation
