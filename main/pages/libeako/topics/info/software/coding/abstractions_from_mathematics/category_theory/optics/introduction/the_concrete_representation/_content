* laws
	* i will express the laws via the accessors of the optic category under examination; for clarity: in the application of the accessor functions: i am going to omit the optic argument [as it is the same optic value in the whole scope of the laws]
* i will not show the implementation of the optic composition functions, because it is trivial or easy to figure out for all categories; but yourself should do figure them out
* subtyping
	* i will talk about subtype relationships between optic categories; these are to be interpreted not technically, but conceptually, mathematically, as ((X is Y) = any X can be converted to an Y)
	* creating an optic for a multi-layer container is best done by creating an optic for each layer individually and compose them; however often the optics corresponding to different layers are from different optic categories and optics from different categories do not compose generally; one solution is to convert all the optics to be composed to a common supertype; hence subtype relationships between optic categories is important
* some common categories
	* "fold"
		* fold is a very simple optic category, it makes us able to query the list of elements of the container
		* let Fold e c = c -> List e
	* "get"
		* get is probably the simplest optic category of all; it is like fold, but the content must contain exactly 1 element
		* let Get e c = c -> e
		* yepp, it is just a function
		* it supposes that the content is a single value
		* a common scenario of get is that the container is a product type and the content is the type of a certain data member of it; but the concept is more general: any function can be regarded as a get
	* "build"
		* build is an optic category, same as get but in the opposite direction; instead of querying the element from the container: it produces a container from an element
		* let Build e c = e -> c
		* a common scenario is injecting a value in a sum type; for example (Right : r -> Either l r) is a build
		* a more common name of build is "review"
	* pairing the directions
		* we can extend get and build by adding to them an accessor with the opposite direction
		* lens
			* for product types
			* let Lens e c = { get : c -> e; set : e -> c -> c }
			* set is similar in purpose to build, but for product types; it can not build the container from an element alone, because the context is not necessarily empty; as a solution it has +1 input: an other value of the container, from which the context to be taken
			* the laws
				* intuitively
					* getting the content after setting it results in the same value that was set
						* set e >>> get = const e
					* setting the got content value results in the original container
						* set (get c) c = c
					* setting twice is equivalent with setting the last time 
						* set something >>> set at_last = set at_last
				* it is possible to derive the laws from the comonad concept
					* Lenses Are Exactly the Coalgebras for the Store Comonad

			* the most straightforward scenario of lens is that it focuses from a product type to a member of that type
				* examples
					* second : Lens y (x y)
				* such lenses are so frequent that we will often have a macro to help their creation
		* prism
			* prism for sum types is like lens for product type
			* Prism e c := { match : c -> Maybe e; build : e -> c }
			* match is the same as get, but the return value is in Maybe, because it does not necessarily exist
			* the laws
				* if i build a container from a content and then match on that container then i get back the content from which i built the container
					* build >>> match = Just
				* if i match on a container and manage to get an element from it and then build a container from the found element then that new container will be the same as the old container
					* fromMaybe c build (match c) := c
						* where fromMaybe :: q -> (p -> q) -> Maybe p -> q
			* a more commmon name of match is "preview"
	* affine traversal
		* often product and sum type constructions are mixed in a multilayer data structure; just think about algebraic datatypes and their ubiquity; hence the need to have an optic category which is a least general supertype of both lens and prism; with other words: we seek an optic category whose capability-set is the intersection of the capability-sets of lens and prism; from this specification: we can derive the representation of such an optic category by merging the representations of lens and prism so that we take the weaker one for each field
		* to recap: here are the data representations of lens and prism
			* Lens e c := { get : c -> e, set : e -> c -> c }
			* Prism e c := { match : c -> Maybe e, build : e -> c }
		* the (container -> content) direction is weaker in prism [it does not necessary return an existing content]; the (content -> container) direction is weaker in lens [it requires an additional container too]; hence
			* NewOpticCategory e c := { match : c -> Maybe e, set : e -> c -> c }
		* the common name of this optic category is "affine traversal"
		* laws: i am too lazy to think about them
	* isomorphism
		* Isomorphism e c := { get : c -> e, build : e -> c }
		* laws
			* get >>> build = id
			* build >>> get = id
		* an isomorphism represents the focus from some data to a possibly different representation of the same data; intuitively: we think about 2 types as isomorphic iff they represent the same information
	* lift
		* Lift e c := (e -> e) -> (c -> c)
		* law: like of functor
		* this is the reification of interface functor
		* name
			* the most common name is "semantic editor combinator"
				* it is coined by Conal Elliot
					\ links-to external http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators
				* i think that the name "semantic editor combinator" is wierd and does not make sense to me
			* an other name is "setter"; i do not like this name because it collides with the set method of lens and they are not equivalent
			* other possible name is "map" or "mapping" or "mapper" or "change" or ... or "lift" or ...
	* traversal
		* the simple lift can be upgraded to be able to lift effecty functions:
		* Traversal e c := forall a . Applicative a => (e -> a e) -> (c -> a c)
		* laws
			* same as of the Traversable interface
				* traversal pure = pure
				* traversal f >>> map (traversal g) = getCompose (traversal (g >>> map f >>> Compose))
					* where Compose f g x := Compose { getCompose : g (f x) }
		* this is the reification of interface traversable
