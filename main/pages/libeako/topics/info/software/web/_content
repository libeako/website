* website look
	* the number of menus should be 1, not 2 or 3
		* multiplicity of menus makes it ambiguous for the user which menu to search
	* do not distribute the buttons around the site, collect them into one single menu
	* use menus to group stuff
		* do not list all cantact options on the main page, put them into a separate page behind a 'contact' element in a menu
	* menus should be at the top, not at the bottom of the page
		* the menu at the bottom is still costly, readers need to parse everything they see in order to dismiss them
	* stop rendering items of a list with alternating sides [left and right]
		* uniformity is simple, elegnat, clean and easy to read
		* alternation is fancy destruction of readability
	* stop using images without honest real messages
		* in current [2010-2025] practice most of the images are just to make (very false) impression of prefessionality
* privacy
	* the attitude in the design of the web is hugely mistaken
		* browsers should not send any info to the website host without the user's explicit command
			* do not send the following infos
				* screen size
					* just make the web content possible to lay out in any sized window automatically by the browser
				* fonts
					* the websites should specify some lists of font preferences and let the browser decide; the website design should not depend on the availability of fonts
				* browser version
				* time-zone
				* under the browser
					* the operating system
						* why the hell should the web depend on the OS used?
					* the hardware under the browser
				* how things are rendered
					* "convas fingerprint"
					* pixels are for the human vier
				* the set of browser extensions
				* ...
		* browsers should not play any audio or video automatically
		* browsers should not run scripts without the consent of the user
			* the vast majority of the honest web operation does not require any script
	* cookies
