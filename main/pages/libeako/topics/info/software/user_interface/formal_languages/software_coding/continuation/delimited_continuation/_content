* this one sounds more specific by the "delimiated" in it; but it is just continuation; really; then why an other name? if i understood correctly : the cause is historical; originally "continuation" meant a special kind of continuation, one that was a continuation of the whole program; obviously such ones can not be composed, hence they are not valueable as a notion; and no reason to distinguish them from general continutations [which are the same as functions]; whole program continuations are just a historical mistake; the general continuations though can be composed; multiple distinguishing names for general continuations exist, they all seem to come from the composability property : "delimited continuation" seems to be the most used one but some others are "composable continuation", "partial continuation", "slice"
