* an audio version of roughly this [in a boring style]

* in the world of software coding industry and academy talk to each other too little; the industry does not know about the goodies the academy discovered, or at least does not know why and how good those are and generally thinks that the academy activity is not worth their attention; adopting these goodies would increase coding efficiency 3-10 *; this is my estimate
* the global software coding cost is roughly half trillion dollar / year; hence the opportunity cost i am talking about here is several hundreds of billions of dollar / year
* these words, "industry" and "academy" are very inaccurate in describing the divisions, but they are the best i could think of; in some situations the words "non-haskellish" and "haskellish" may be better
* this part does not contain technically useful information; it is about history, social, psychic aspects of the software coding technology
* technological differencies
