* low level control in a programming language is for manual optimization
* but that does not mean that low level is good for efficiency; rather : it only changes the efficiency story [optimizability =/= efficiency]
	* human capacity is limited to handle complexity; though the human is more clever than the compiler algorithm in optimizing program for simple task, with the increase of the complexity of the task the human loses his|her ability to optimize, while the compiler is not affected by complexity; hence a level of complexity exists at which the human is already worse than the compiler
	* low level coding is more time consuming, and in exchange provides more ability for low level optimization; high level programming generally saves programming time, which can be spent on high level optimization [asymptotic improvements]; high level optimization may earn more than low level, again : usually more so as complexity grows
