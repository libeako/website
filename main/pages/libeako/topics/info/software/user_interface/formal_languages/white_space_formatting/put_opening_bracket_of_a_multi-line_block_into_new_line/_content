* the text structure should match the syntax tree structure
	# links-to internal wndpwtiwdwsvwwzc
	* this ergonomics consideration is the basis of this section
* when a block of code uses multiple lines then parts of it are separated from each other by line-break, hence the block itself should also be separated from its neighbor by at least a line-break
* example
	* use this
		* void f (...)
		* {
			* ... 
		* }
	* instead of this
		* void f (...) {
			* ...
		* }
* the readability is better because
	* the structure of the text is more similar to the structure of the concrete syntax tree
	* the appearance reflects the fact that the opening and closing brace have the same meaning; the opening and closing bracket has the same horizontal position, so it is easy to match them; the block has a block-like appearance
	* the function header is cleaner
	* the block is better separated from the header of the block vertically too
* the disadvantage is only that +1 line is used
