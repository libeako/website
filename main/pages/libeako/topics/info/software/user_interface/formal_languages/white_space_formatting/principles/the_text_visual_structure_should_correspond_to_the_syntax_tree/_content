* my fundamental law of user interface design is that the structure of the representation should correspond to the structure of the represented
* the structure
	* of the program code
		* is the concrete syntax tree
	* of the text is
		* indentation and alignment
		* indentation is nestable, alignment is not; hence the winner among the 2 is indentation; but do they fight against each other? can they not be both applied? they can; but i think readability would be better if people sticked to a single method
* the structural correspondence law implies that (parts of the text that are closer to each other by meaning [in the syntax tree] are also closer to each other in appearance [formatting]); this makes the formatting easier to
	* read
		* a great example for this is ordinary natural language text in books, websites, pdf articles; in them one may easily observe that the higher in the structure of the text a sequence of parts are, the more white-space is interleaved into it to separate the parts; with other words : bigger parts need stronger separation
		* the part types in descending order
			* section
			* paragraph
			* word
			* letter
	* edit
		* for example it is easier to select and move a block of text then if the part partially occupies some lines
