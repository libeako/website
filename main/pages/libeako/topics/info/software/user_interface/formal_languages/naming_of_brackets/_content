* brackets have multiple names, depending on the shape of the bracket character
	* "bracket"
	* "parentheses"
	* "braces"
* my opinion
	* there should be a general name for them
		* "bracket" seems okay
	* and the difference between the shape kinds should be expressed with an adjective
		* [square bracket]
		* (round bracket)
		* <angle bracket>
		* {curly bracket}
