* i worked for 10 years as a software coder
	* mainly related to algorithms
	* most of my time was spent on coding and debugging
	* i used mainly languages c++, c#
* i was always keen to make my code safe, modular, nice, clean; i soon realized that the programming languages i used limited me in this goal; hence i was interested in alternative programming languages
* i was hopping from one programming languages to another, being satisfied with neither of them
* i was also wondering by myself : what would be the ideal programming language for me; i had the requirement that it should be universal in the sense that is should be able to represent programs and run them on any platform; i came to the conclusion that then it must be functional;  the first programming language that i liked was ML, which is functional; by learning about this language and using it i fall in love with functional programming
* being already in the functional world : i could not avoid seeing that many people talk about the Haskell programming language; i resisted to learn it for years because i thought that it is domain specific and slow; but seeing that many people admire it i eventually did learn it; it was one of the greatest things happened to me as a programmer; my former reasons to worry about it turned out to be false and i found a great programming research community and efforts around it with great results; these results enhance the effectiveness of software coding many times
* because the efficiency gain of this knowledge is enormous : i better try to teach, convince about it to fellow coders than to practice it myself; even if i manage to convert only 2 fellow coders to believe in and use this knowledge then already i made more economical value then i would by using it myself; hence it became my passion to teach and convince; this part of my website is largely dedicated for this goal
