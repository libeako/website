* if it is unavoidable to use a dangerous thing but the need for it is rare then
	* let the programming language strictly require each piece of code that contains the danger to declare this fact
	* let the compiler track the danger
		* that is: all the pieces of code containing an other dangerous piece must also be annotated in the same way
			* for example
				* all the functions that may invoke non-deterministic function must themselves declare to be non-deterministic
	* the declaration of the contained danger happens in the interface of the code fragment, hence we can name this solution with the phrase "honest interfacing"
	* it is important that the language requires the honesty and the compiler verifies it
