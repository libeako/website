* representation of conjunction and disjunction
	* rep (S1 and S2) := S1 * S2
	* rep (S1 or  S2) := S1 + S2
* this is very simple and intuitive
	* it is the product type that has a value exactly when both of its components types have values
	* similarly for disjunction
* these 2 type constructions [product, sum] are duals of each other and the logical construct types that they induce are duals of each other too
