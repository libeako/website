* a derivation system is a set of rules which produce objects, possible from previously derived objects
* when the objects are interpreted as statements then
	* we can say that derivation is "deduction"
	* these statements are not propositions
		* because they can not be disproved, only deduced;
	* instead: these statements are said to be "judgements"
	* deduction of statements can be considered as proving if the deduction rules are consistent with some logic
