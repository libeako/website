* you could have discovered proposition-as-type by yourself
	* even without proposition-as-type: we have the ability to verify proofs of properties with the ubiquitously static type checking; what the static type checking does is it veryfies that a given term has a given type
		* but it feels to weak capability; but it turns out that this capability is not weak at all, its power is infinite, but only our type systems are weak usually
	* let us try to apply type checking to prove generally any provable propositions; we know it can prove that a given term has a given type and we want it to prove that a given proof proves a given proposition
	* hence what we need is to represent propositions as types and proofs of that proposition as ordinary terms of that type
	* what proposition do we prove when we show an instance of a type? that the type has an instance; hence if we want to be able to prove a proposition than we only need to find a type that is inhabited if and only if the proposition that is represents is true
* this idea is not tricky, it is not only a human invention; instead it has a deep and simple and natural theoretical foundation
	* both of the 2 worlds [construction, logic] have a common structure-
		* categorical

		* in both world the practicioners are composing some kinds of things, and that is a very important aspect of practising
			* in the constructive world the practitioners are composing functions
				* this can be more intuitive if you look at it from a software engineer point of view; software engineers compose programs from smaller programs
					* as imperative program are lists of instructions, so are functional programs lists of functions to be composed as normal function composition
			* in the logical world the practitioners are composing proofs of theorems; the theorems are generally in implication form [they have premiss and consequence]
	* acquired correspondence: proofs of implications - functions
	* in the categorical view: these are the arrows of the respective categories; the logical world is a category of proofs of implications, the constructive world is a category of functions
	* the functions are between types and the implications proofs are between propositions; with the categorical view: the in the logical world the objects propositions, in the constructive world the objects are types
	* learned correspondence: propositions - types
	* how to represent propositions with types? because the value-set of propositions have 2 elements [false, true]: the question is: which types represent true and which types represent false propositions?
	* we can answer that question in the same way that we did so far: using category theory; try to give category theoretical definition to the meaning of truth and false, as proposition values; think about it for a little before reading on;
	* ready? here it comes
	* the true propositions are the ones the are implied by any other proposition
		* intuitively: true is already true, it does not require any more precondition
	* the false propositions are the ones that imply every other proposition
		* intuitively: if false is true then everything else is true too
	* how does this translate to the construction world?
		* the true propositions are represented by types that have function into them from all types
		* the false propositions are represented by types that have functions from them to all types
	* which these types are?
		* type from which function exists into every type
			* and
				* those target types include empty types; only empty types can be sources of functions going into empty types
				* from empty types function do exist into every type
			* => these are exactly the empty types
		* type into which function exists from every type
			* and
				* those source types include non-empty types; only non-empty types can be targets of functions coming from non-empty types
				* into non-empty types functions exist from every type
			* => these are exactly the non-empty types
	* learned correspondence
		* false propositions - empty types
		* true propositions - non-empty types
	* true and false propositions are a partitioning of propositions and the correspondence we found for them in the construction world - the empty and non-empty types - are also a partitioning of types; this is necessary, but it is still appriciatable that we achieved it without explicitely trying to achieve it, as this consistency gives to us a reassuring feedback that we are on good track
	* rephrasing the previous result: the proposition represented by a type is true if and only if the type is inhabited
