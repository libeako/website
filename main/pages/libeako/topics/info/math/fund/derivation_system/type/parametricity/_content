* the input of a function can be a "parameter", which means [loosely speaking] that the structure of the output may not depend on the actual value of the input; knowing such fact [perhaps because it is declared in the type of the function] makes as able to sometimes deduce useful properties of the function, without knowing its definition, only knowing its type
* definition
	* "parameter"
		* an input i is parameter when the output may not depend on the particular value of the input, other than simple referring to the input
		* a more down-to-earth explanation
			* assume that the function maps
				* x to ...x...
					* by "...x..." i mean an evaluated expression that refer to x
			*  then the function must map
				* y to ...y..., where ...y... is the same as ...x... with the only exception that the "x"s are replaced with "y"s
		* examples
			* \ x -> 5
			* \ x -> x
			* \ x -> (x, x)
	* "index"
		* an input is "index" when it is not parameter
* some terminology
	* iff the input of a function is parameter then we can say that the function is "parametric"
	* a multi-input function can be parametric "in" some of its inputs and not in some others
* parametric type polymorphism
