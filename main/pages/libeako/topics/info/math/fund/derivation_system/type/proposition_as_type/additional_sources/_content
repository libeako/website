	* article
		* Propositions as Types
			\ links-to external http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf
		* this text is a masterpiece
		* i read it twice
			* once when i was very noobish, i hardly knew anything about this or related subjects; the text was still understandable somewhat
			* but when i already knew some lambda calculus, type theory and logic then it struck me how well Philip Wadler could explain the topic; the text is structured very well, it is compact, precise, deep, understandable, interesting
