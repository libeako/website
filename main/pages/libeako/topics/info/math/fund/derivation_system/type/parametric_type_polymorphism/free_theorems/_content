* assuming type parametricity one can deduce useful mathematical properties about values just from their types
* example:
	* what can you tell about the functions with these following types? [assuming the functions are parametric in all their type inputs]
		* x -> x
		* x -> y
		* x -> (x -> y) -> y
		* y -> (x -> y)
		* (x -> y -> r) -> (y -> x -> r)
		* ((x, y) -> r) -> (x -> y -> r)
	* here are the solutions, in order:
		* is the identity function
		* does not exist
		* is the function application function
		* is the constant function
		* flips the inputs of the function
		* is the curry function
	* these properties are intutitive, but also can be proved formally
* we are talking about properties of a value deduced from only the type of the value, independent of the implementation of the value; many implementations may exist of a type, but we do not have to pay the cost of the proof of these properties for all the implementations one-by-one; but instead only for once : based on the type only - this is the source of the name "free theorem"; in my opinion the name "parametricity consequence" may have been a better name, but "free theorem" is more popular
* philip wadler discovered a method to automatically derive a free theorem from a type-parametric type
	* still the main source of information about it is
		* his scientific article

			* this article is difficult to understand for amateurs
			* i managed to grasp some intuition for a less general version of it
				* in my model i use function instead of relation
					* this is less powerful, but for me was good enough for many cases
				* my intuition is based on data type equivalence
				* the program should be the same if we replace some data with equivalent but differently typed data
				* this equivalence in my model is not total, the replacement can lose some information
* advanced
	* Amal Ahmed gave a detailed lecture about the topic, including the formalization of the theorem and its proof
