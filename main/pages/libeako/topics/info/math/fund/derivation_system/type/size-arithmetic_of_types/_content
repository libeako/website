* often the names of type composing functions is from arithmetic
* this is founded on a homomorphism from (the algebra of types) to (the algebra of non-negative integers), which is the size function that maps to a type t the number of values of t
	* in more earthy language
		* by "size" of a type t i mean the number of values of t
		* the size of a product type is the product of the sizes of types of its members
		* the size of a sum type is the sum of the sizes of the types of its members
		* the size of a function type from x to y is (size y) ^ (size x)
