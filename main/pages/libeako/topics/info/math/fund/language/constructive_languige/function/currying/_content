* the most natural method to represent multi-input function is to pack the inputs by product type construction
	* ((x1, x2) -> y)
* an alternative is the "curried" form
	* x1 -> (x2 -> y)
* we may drop the brackets for elegance, -> is right associative for this ability
	* x1 -> x2 -> y
* converting between these 2 usual representations of functions is a common task
	* curry : ((a, b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c)
	* curry f a b = f (a, b)
	* uncurry : (a -> b -> c) -> ((a, b) -> c)
	* uncurry : f p = f (_1 p) (_2 p)
* the name "currying" comes from the fact that Haskell Curry was one of the first who used the curried form; [though he stated that he learned it from Sch√∂nfinkel]
