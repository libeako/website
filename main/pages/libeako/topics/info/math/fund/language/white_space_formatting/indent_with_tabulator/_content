* tabulator is more correct theoretically, because it expresses indentation exactly
* tabulator can be viewed by everyone so big as he likes, just a trivial setting in the editor
* no need for space
	* the only reason to use space is alignment
	* aligning is bad practice

	* do not use it
* automatic resize of indentation is not possible with spaces; because the algorithm may not know in all situation if the author intended the spaces for alignment or for indentation
* choosing tab can not be wrong decision; because you can switch to spaces any time without any difficulty; but the opposite direction is difficult [you chose spaces probably because you wanted to use alignment]
