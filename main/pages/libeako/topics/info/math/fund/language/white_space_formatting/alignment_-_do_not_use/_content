* alignment was invented in order to start a block of code [which is a subtree in the concrete syntax tree] at the end of the line of the header of the block
* example
	* my_awesome_function x =
		* let local_value = some_value
			* in do_something_with local_value
* this is a semantical indentation - the indentation adheres to the semantical structure of the code [the meaning of the code]
* a usual competitor of this style is
	* my_awesome_function x = let local_value = some_value
		* in do_something_with local_value
* , to save 1 line; but the appearance lost its block appearance; 
* alignment is used sometimes
	* that is aligning the line "in do_something_with local_value" horizontally to start where the let-expression starts
* i will refer to the semantically indented version with "indented"
* looking at this simple artificial static example: the reason to like the aligned one seems obvious
	* looks better because the name of the declared thing is separated, it does not overlap horizontally with the value that is bound to it
	* uses 1 less line, due to utilizing the header line of the whole code block
* but in realistic scenarios the table often turns
	* in the aligned version the value side of the equation starts more to the right, hence it has less space horizontally; if the block is bigger, then the probability is also bigger of having to break a line compared to the same line in the indented version and by this making the aligned version to use more lines
	* if the name of the defined thing or its arguments changes
		* to longer
			* then in the aligned version the horizontal space decreases, hence breaking of long lines may become necessary
		* to shorter
			* then also, not from necessity but to save space
		* such reformatting is almost impossible to do perfectly via automation
