* my fundamental law of user interface design is that the structure of the representation should correspond to the structure of the represented
* the structure
	* of the program code
		* is the concrete syntax tree
	* of the text is indentation and spaces and brackets
* the structural correspondence law implies that (parts of the text that are closer to each other by meaning [in the syntax tree] should also be closer to each other in appearance [formatting]); this makes the formatting easier to
	* read
		* a great example for this is ordinary natural language text in books, websites, pdf articles; in them one may easily observe that the higher in the structure of the text a sequence of parts are, the more white-space is interleaved into it to separate the parts; with other words: bigger parts need stronger separation
		* the part types in descending order
			* section
			* paragraph
			* word
			* letter
		* notice that the higher level parts are separated from their neighbors by more white-space; i am sure you agree that this is good style; now apply the same principle in your code too
	* edit
		* for example it is easier to select and move a block of text then if the part partially occupies some lines
