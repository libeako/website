* "statement", "proposition", "judgement"
	* the distinction between these is a difficult problem for novices in logic and type theory; it was for me for long time; one cause of this is that even professionals differ in it;
	* my current understanding :
		* category "proposition" and category "judgement" form a partitioning of category "statement"
			* a proposition is a statement at the object level
			* a judgement is a statement at the meta level
* categorization of deduction systems
	* the famous ones are : hilbert style, natural deduction, sequent calculus
	* for long i did not understand the difference between them, so here is what helped me :
	* the difference between hilbert style and natural deduction
		* i start from programming
			* the lambda calculus and the ski calculus are equivalent : each formula in one can be expressed with the other in an isomorphic way; the difference between them is rather formal : lambda calculus has something extra : lambda definitions
		* the same is the difference between these 2 deduction systems, because
			* lambda calculus corresponds to natural deduction
				* for explanation see for example Wadler : Propositions as Types
			* ski calculus corresponds to hilbert style deduction
		* the "lambda variable" corresponds to the "assumption" in the natural deduction; the ski calculus does not have lambdas and the corresponding deduction system, the hilbert style one does not have assumptions; this is the difference : the assumptions
	* the difference between sequence calculus and natural deduction
		* in natural deduction the consequent contains exactly 1 statement
		* in sequent calculus the consequent may contain any number of statement
