* informally :
	* if a logic is consistent then it is incomplete
	* proof without mathematical rigour :
		* "this sentence is not provable"
		* is the sentence above provable ?
			* yes :
				* it is true [because of the soundness precondition], thus it is not provable; provable and not-provable => the logic is inconsistent
			* no :
				* the sentence is true; we have a sentence which is true and not provable, that is the logic is incomplete
