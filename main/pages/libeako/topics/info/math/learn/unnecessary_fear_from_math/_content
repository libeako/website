* exists in most people
* i guess it stems from the incorrect method of learning math
	* this is exaggerated by state schools
		* the main thing in learning math is understaning
		* the goal of state schools is often to have good exam results; hence they focus on teaching application of math [solving usual math excercises] instead of understanding it; but math without understanding is really useless
		* understanding is hard to force, it can stem only from genuine curiosity
		* state schools force a common speed of learning for pupils with highly different state of mind
* everyone is capable to learn math; really; this is not just sweet-talking from me, i really think this
