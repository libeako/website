* galois connection
	* "The Galois Connection between Syntax and Semantics"
		* by Peter Smith
		* this is a wonderful mini-book; it introduces order theory at a very minimal level, then galois connection, then a usage of it in logic between theories and models; and all of it is very understandable
		* because of the logic part - i recommend to read this to logic students just after they learned the very basic definitions of "theory" and "model"
