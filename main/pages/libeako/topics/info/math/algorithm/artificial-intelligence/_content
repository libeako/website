* neuron network
	* introduction
		* Michael Nielsen: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
			* good for intro
			* biggest negative is verbosity
		* by Brandon Rohrer

* natural language
	* vectorization of words
		* intuition for the simplest algorithm
			* the initial vectors are random
			* loop
				* take a couple of words near each other
				* move their vectors somewhat closer to each other
	* attention mechanism
		* “Attention is All You Need”
		* the Q, K, V neural-nets
			* are constant inside an attention block
			* they learn the language
