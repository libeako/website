* category theory is very abstract
	* abstractness gives power
	* abstractness makes understanding difficult
		* you can decrease the difficulty of this abstractness by separating it into the 2 aspects: objects and arrows; categories can have multiple objects and multiple arrows; for every category theoretical idea one can try to understand it first for categories with single objects [monoids] and for categories with single or zero arrows between pairs of objects [preorders]
