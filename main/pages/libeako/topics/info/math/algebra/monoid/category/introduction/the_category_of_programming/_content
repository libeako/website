* though i already used this category, for the very introduction into category theory, still it is worth to see it separately, because it is very important; so i repeat the correspondence between programs and category here
* 
	* programs --- category
	* type --- object
	* function between types --- arrow between objects
* several names of this correspondence
	* "category of programming" - i like this one
	* "category of types"
	* "category of types and functions"
	* "syntactic category"
