* intuition
	* it is well known that all things are isomorphic with a thing that can turn any continuation to the result of the continuation
	* with formalism
		* x ≅ λ (r : Type) -> (x -> r) -> r
	* you can easily find the functions that map from one side to the other; that gives you an intuitive justification of the isomorphism; but proving that they are inverses of each other is difficult because it needs a free theorem
		* link to 'free theorems'
			\ links-to internal ejqpvlbcoexibqku
	* you can find the proof including the free theorem in the article (Philip Wadler : Theorems for free!)
* the general form of the yoneda lemma
	* adds a functor "F"
	* F x ≅ λ (r : Type) -> (x -> r) -> F r
	* the previously shown concrete version can be recovered from this general version by F := the identity functor
	* the proof of this theorem in its full category-theoretic generality is easy and available in almost all category-theory introductory books

* "the yoneda functor"
	* is a popular name for the right side of the yoneda isomorhism as expressed above
	* in haskell can be expressed like this
		* newtype Yoneda f c = forall r . (c -> r) -> f r
* the dual
	* 2 possibilities of dualizing the yoneda lemma are interesting :
	* for contravariant functor
		* this is a very simple possibility of dualizing
		* F x ≅ λ (r : Type) -> (r -> x) -> F r
		* here F is contravariant
	* an other possibility
		* Coyoneda f x := f c (c -> x)
		* notice that the type variable c is existentially qualified here
		* the conyoneda functor is the free functor
		* additional source
