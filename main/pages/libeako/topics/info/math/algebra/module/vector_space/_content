* 'vector space' is just a module with unity such that the scalar slot is not only ring but field
* a vector space is "Banach" iff it is normed and complete
* linear dependence
	* some vectors are 'linearly dependent' iff one of them is in the span of the others
	* 'linearly independent' iff not linearly dependent
* subspace
