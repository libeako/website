* equivalent conditions
	* proposition
		* are equivalent
			* U is subspace
			* and
				* 0 is in U
				* forall x1, x2 in U. (x1 + x2) in u
				* forall (s scalar) (u in U). (s * u) in U
	* proof is trivial
* 'sum of subspaces' is just sums over their value-sets
	* trivial to prove that the sum is a subspace
* the sum is the smallest containing subspace
	* proof is trivial
* some subspaces are 'linearly dependent' iff one of them has non-trivial [containing more than the 0 vector] intersection with the span of the others
* 'direct sum' is same as sum but is defined only for linearly independent subspaces
