* an isomorphism exists between the 2 representations of semilattices, between the ones based on:
	* operation
		\ links-to internal xizqxawbezpbbtcb
	* order
		\ links-to internal itknuxndzyspgrag
* let "make-se" be the function that maps an operation to an order as:
	* make_se <> x y := x <> y = y
* let "make-<>" be the function in the opposite direction that maps a [partial] order to its join function
* statement: make-se and make-<> are inverse of each other
* proof
	* mapping into the other representation:
		* make-<> creates a semilattical operation
			* proof is trivial
		* make-se creates an order
			* proof:
				* se x y := make-se <> x y
				* we prove that se is an ordering:
					* reflexive
						* <> is idempotent => x <> x = x => se x x
					* transitive
						* suppose:
							* se x y and se y z
						* then:
							* after substituting the definition of se:
								* x <> y = y and y <> z = z
							* => x <> z = x <> (y <> z) = {- <> is associative -} (x <> y) <> z) = y <> z = z
							* thus: x <> z = z
							* => {- by definition of se-} se x z 
					* antisymmetric
						* suppose: se x y and se y x
						* then:
							* by definition of se: x <> y = y and y <> x = x
							* by commutativity of <>: x = y
	* proof of isomorphism:
		* make-<> >>> make-se = id
			* proof is trivial, just branch on (se x y)
		* make-<> is surjective, because
			* and
				* any semilattical operation can be represented by an ordering
					* this is proved in the previous section 
				* the selecting core of semilattical operation determines the rest of its domain
