* as definition, "join" and "meet" are the binary versions of the extremums 
	* join : X -> X -> Maybe X
	* meet : X -> X -> Maybe X
	* join x1 x2 = supremum {x1, x2}
	* meet x1 x2 =  infimum {x1, x2}
* for the common name of join and meet i may use "jomee" or "mejo"; derived from that i may also use the words "mejoical", "mejoical", ...
* join and meet
	* are
		* reflexive
		* idempotent
		* commutative
			* obviously, because they are built on the sets of their arguments
		* associative
			* proof by the 'extremum extremums do not depend on construction' theorem
