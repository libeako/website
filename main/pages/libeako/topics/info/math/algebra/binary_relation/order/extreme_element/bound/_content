* definition
	* let ss be a subset of s
	* let r be an 
		* ordering
			\ links-to internal xpcrgldjsphzyebu
	* x is lower bound of ss in s <=> forall y in ss . r x y
	* y is upper bound of ss in s <=> forall x in ss . r x y
* note
	* the bound of a set does not have to be in that set
	* the bound concept depends on a containing set
	* the upper and lower bound concepts are dual of each other through flipping r
* "smallest" and "greatest" element - when the containing set is the same

	* definition
		* x is smallest <=> x is lower bound of s in s
		* y is greatest <=> y is upper bound of s in s
	* theorem: smallest and greates elements are unique
		* proof
			* suppose values x, y are both smallest [similarly of greatest] bounds
				* then r x y and r y x
				* r is an ordering, hence it is antisymmetric, hence x = y
