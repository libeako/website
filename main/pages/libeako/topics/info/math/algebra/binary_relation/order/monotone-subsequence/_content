* theorem: 
	* in every infinite subsequence 
		* exists a subsequence which is monotone increasing
		* exists a subsequence which is monotone decreasing
	* proof
		* let 'peak point' mean the property of a position that the element there is greater or equal to all the later elements
		* suppose the amount if peak points is infinite
			* then they form a monotone increasing sub-sequence
			* else
				* we can always find a greater element later; this proves that a monotone increasing sequence exists
		* the existence of a monotone decreasing sequence is similarly provable
	* usual names fot this theorem include "peak point lemma", "spanish hotel theorem"
