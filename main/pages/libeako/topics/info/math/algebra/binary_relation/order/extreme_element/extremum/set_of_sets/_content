		* let
			* XX, YY be sets of sets
			* the supremums of their elements exist
			* (the union of the elements of XX) contain (the union of the elements of YY)
				* i may use "union containment" to refer to this condition
		* then the (upper bounds of the supremums of the elements of XX) are (upper bounds of the supremums of elements of YY)
	* proof
		* let b be an upper bound of the supremums
		* then
			* forall x element of element of XX: se x b
				* by transitivity of se
			* forall y element of element of YY: se y b
				* by the union containment
			* hence forall Y element of YY: 
				* b is an upper bound of Y
				* supremum Y is also an upper bound of Y
				* supremum Y is the smallest one among them => se (supremum Y) b
	* the same with infimums and lower bounds
* extremum bounds do not depend on construction

		* let
			* XX, YY be sets of sets
			* the supremums of their elements exist
			* (the union of the elements of XX) = (the union of the elements of YY)
		* then (the upper bounds of the supremums of the elements of XX) = (the upper bounds of the supremums of elements of YY)
	* this theorem is the equality version of the

	* hence the proof is a trivial application of that theorem in the 2 directions

	* judgement
		* let
			* XX, YY be sets of sets
			* the extremums of their elements exist
			* (the union of the elements of XX) = (the union of the elements of YY)
		* then 
			* the existence of either of
				* the supremum of the supremums of the elements of XX
				* the supremum of the supremums of the elements of YY
			* implies the existence of the other
			* and then they are equal
	* this theorem is a straightforward consequence of the 
		* 'extremum bounds do not depend on construction' theorem
			\ links-to internal sgjjrsmzonhzhuiu
	* analogously with infimum
	* an important case of this theorem is when one of the set of sets contains only 1 set:
		* let
			* X be a set of sets
			* the extremums of its elements exist
		* then
			* the existence of either of
				* the supremum of the supremums of the elements of X
				* the supremum of the union of the elements of x
			* implies the existence of the other
			* and then they are equal
