	* their dual
* proof
	* it is enough to prove only one of the situations, the other is automatically proved by the duality principle
	* we need
		* forall x y
			* join x (meet x y) = x
	* using 
		* the isomorphism between the 2 main representations of semilattice
			\ links-to internal yfrehcdkxqrbrkoy
	* switch = to (se and ge)
		* se (join x (meet x y)) x
		* ge (join x (meet x y)) x
	* the ge goal is trivially given by join being an upper bound of its arguments
	* the se goal is given by
		* and
			* meet being a lower bound of its arguments
			* x being an upper bound of both of the arguments of join here and join by definition being the minimal among such
