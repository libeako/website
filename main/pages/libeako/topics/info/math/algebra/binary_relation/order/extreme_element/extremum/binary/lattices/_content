* "semilattice"
	* definition
		* let
			* S : Set
			* se : S -> S -> Bool
			* j be the join function induced by se; let j be total
		* then (S, j) is a "join-semilattice"
	* thus: a "join-semilattice" is just a total join function
	* analogously for meet
* isomorphism of 2 representations of semilattices
