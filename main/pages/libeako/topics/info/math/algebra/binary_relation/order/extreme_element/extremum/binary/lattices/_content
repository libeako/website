* "semilattice"
	* definition
		* let
			* S : Set
			* se : S -> S -> Bool
			* j be the join function induced by se; let j be total
		* then (S, j) is a "join-semilattice"
	* thus: a "join-semilattice" is just a total join function
	* analogously for meet
* equivalence of 2 definitions of semilattice 
	\ id yfrehcdkxqrbrkoy
	* the 2 definitions, based on:
		* operation
			\ links-to internal xizqxawbezpbbtcb
		* order
			\ links-to internal itknuxndzyspgrag
	* order-based definition => operation based definition
		* proof is trivial
	* operation based definition => order-based definition
		* proof
			* se x y := x <> y = y
			* we prove that se is an ordering:
				* reflexive
					* <> is idempotent => x <> x = x => se x x
				* transitive
					* suppose:
						* se x y and se y z
					* then:
						* after substituting the definition of se:
							* x <> y = y and y <> z = z
						* => x <> z = x <> (y <> z) = {- <> is associative -} (x <> y) <> z) = y <> z = z
						* thus: x <> z = z
						* => {- by definition of se-} se x z 
				* antisymmetric
					* suppose: se x y and se y x
					* then:
						* by definition of se: x <> y = y and y <> x = x
						* by commutativity of <>: x = y
