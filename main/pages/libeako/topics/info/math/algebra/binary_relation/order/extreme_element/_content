* to work easier in this section: if not stated otherwise: let s : Type, r : s -> s -> Bool
* "smallest" and "greatest" elements
	* definition
		* x is smallest <=> forall y . r x y
		* y is greatest <=> forall x . r x y
	* smallest and greates are dual of each other through flipping r
* "minimal" and "maximal" elements
	\ id tamhgiftsvhkahfs
	* definition
		* x is minimmal <=> (forall y . r y x => x = y)
		* y is maximmal <=> (forall x . r y x => x = y)
	* minimal and maximal are dual of teach other through flipping r
* smallest is minimal, greatest is maximal
* in a total ordering {minimal, maximal} elements are {smallest, greates}
