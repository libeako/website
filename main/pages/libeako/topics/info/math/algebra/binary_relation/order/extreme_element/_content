* "minimal" and "maximal" element
	\ id tamhgiftsvhkahfs
	* definition
		* x is minimmal <=> (forall y . r y x => x = y)
		* y is maximmal <=> (forall x . r y x => x = y)
	* the minimal and maximal concepts are dual of teach other through flipping r
	* see also:
		* "smallest" and "greatest" element
			\ links-to internal amjhlrfsqefgrhhq
	* obvious theorem: smallest is minimal, greatest is maximal
	* in a total ordering {minimal, maximal} elements are {smallest, greates}
* "extremums": "infimum" and "supremum"
