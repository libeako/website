* statement
	* "primary" representation of boolean algebra => the neutral values (of the binary methods) complement each other
* proof of (complement bottom = top)
	* complement bottom
	* =
		* by bottom being neutral value of join
	* join (complement bottom) bottom
	* =
		* by complementation
	* top
* proof of (complement top = bottom): dually
