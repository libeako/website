* statement
	* representation "primary" of boolean algebra => (top is abrorber of join) and (bottom is absorber of meet)
* proof
	* proof of top being absorber value of join
		* join x top
		* =
			* by top being a neutral value of meet
		* meet top (join x top)
		* =
			* by complementation
		* meet (join x (complement x)) (join x top)
		* =
			* by distributivity of meet over join
		* join x (meet (complement x) top)
		* =
			* by top being a neutral value of meet
		* join x (complement x) =
		* =
			* by complementation
		* top
	* proof of bottom being absorber value of join: dually
