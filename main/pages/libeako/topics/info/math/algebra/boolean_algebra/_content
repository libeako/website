* note that join and meet are dual of each other
* representation
	* S : Set
	* join, meet : S -> S -> S
	* join, meat are commutative and distributive over the other
	* complement : S -> S
	* either of:
		* these:
			* "primary"
				* join has neutral value "bottom", meet has neutral value "top"
				* property "complementation"
					* foreach x in S.
						* join x (complement x) = top
						* meet x (complement x) = bottom
			* "secondary"
				* S is not empty
				* join, lean are associative
				* join, lean absorb the other
				* extremum with complement behaves like neutral
					* forall c:
						* join (meet c (complement c)) = id
						* meet (join c (complement c)) = id
		* proof of equivalence

* complementation determines the complement uniquely
	\ links-to internal zrobznmnhavkbwhp
* complement >>> complement = id
	* proof is trivial, using (complementation determines the complement uniquely)
* the neutral element is absorber
