* statement
	* the join method can be cancelled:
	* if for each x y c d
		* and
			* d = complement c
			* join x c = join y c
			* join x d = join y d
	* then x = y
* proof
	* x = meet (join x c) (join x d)
		* proof
			* x
			* =
				* by bottom being neutral value of join
			* join x bottom
			* =
				* by complementation
			* join x (meet c d)
			* =
				* by distributivity of meet join over meet
			* meet (join x c) (join x d)
	* y = meet (join y c) (join y d)
		* proof: dually
	* hence
		* by the assumption of the theorem
	* x = y
* dually for meet
