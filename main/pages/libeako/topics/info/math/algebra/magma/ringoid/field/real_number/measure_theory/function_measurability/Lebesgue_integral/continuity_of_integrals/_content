* proposition
	* if
		* X T : Set
		* X is measured
		* f : T -> X -> Real
			* forall (x : X). flip f x is continuous
		* g : X -> Real
			* integrable
		* forall (x : X). forall (t : T). norm (f t x) <= g x
	* then
		* f is integrable
		* (f >>> integral) is continuous
* proof
	* the integrability of (f _) is implied by the dominance of the integrable (g _)
	* F t := integral (f t)
	* the continuity of F is equivalent to
		* forall convergent (k : Nat -> T). F (limit k) = limit (k >>> F)
		* this is given by
			* the dominated convergence theorem of Lebesuge integrals
