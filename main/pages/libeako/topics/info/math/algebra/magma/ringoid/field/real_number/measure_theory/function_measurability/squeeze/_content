* almost everywhere equal measurable functions squeeze function between them to be measurable in complete measure space
* proposition
	* if
		* (S, M, m) complete measure space
		* fl, fm, fh : M -> Extended Real
			* fl, fh are measurable
			* forall x : M. fl x <= fm x <= fh x
			* (fl = fh) almost everywhere
	* then
		* fm is measurable
* proof
	* take arbitrary (l : Extended Real)
	* dom f := lift (inverse f) [-infinity .. l)
	* we need to prove
		* dom fm is measurable
	* we know
		* dom fl is measurable
		* dom fh is measurable
	* co := intersect {dom fl, dom fh}
		* is measurable
	* el := dom fl \ co
	* em := dom fm \ co
	* eh := dom fh \ co
	* from ((fl = fh) almost everywhere)
		* m el = 0
		* m eh = 0
	* using the completeness of the measure space in the following
	* from (foreach x : S. fl x <= fm x <= fh x)
		* dom fh <= dom fm <= dom fl
		* hence
		* eh <= em <= el
	* hence (m em = 0)
