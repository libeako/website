* the usefulness of the Lebesgue integral is not computing it for exotic functions but as a tool for proving theorems
* "indicator function" of a set outputs 1 on the set and 0 elsewhere
* a "simple function" outputs finite number of values and for each its inverse image is measurable
	* standard form of simple function f
		* (I, M, m)
		* I, O : Set
		* f : I -> O
		* D : Set; finite
		* p : D -> M
			* a partitioning of I
			* also said to be the "bases" of f
		* v : D -> O
			* all distinct
		* forall d : D
			* (p d) is measurable
			* lift f (p d) = {v d}
		* f = sum { for d : D. v d * m (p d) }
	* a "step function" is a simple function with maximum 2 values
* the Lebesgue integral of a simple function in standard form is as you expect
	* null-sets do not contribute to the set, not even if the output of the integrated function is infinite
		* this is the root of the (0 * infinite = 0) convention
	* we can deviate from the standard form of the function to be integrated by dropping the condition that the output values are all distinct, we still get the same integral value
		* this implies that the choice of the base partitioning does not matter either, as any 2 can be refined to a common one by taking the intersections
* integral of (constant * simple function) = constant * integral of simple function
	* proof is trivial
* integral of sum of finite number of simple functions = the sum of the integrals
	* proof is trivial: traverse all the integsections of the measurable base-sets
* if f1, f2 are simple functions and (f1 < f2) then (integral f1 < integral f2)
	* proof is trivial: form a common base partition
* integral of non-negative functions
	* f : S -> Extended Real
		* non-negative, measurable
	* integral f := sup (lift integral {g non-negative simple function | g <= f})
	* this definition is a generalization of (integral of simple functions)
		* proof is trivial
* monotone leniently increasing sequence of simple functions

* extending to negative function outputs
	* a function is "integrable" iff it is measurable and the integrals of its positive and negative parts are finite
		* the integral is defined as the difference between the integrals of the 2 parts
	* a function is integrable iff its pointwise norm is integrable
		* proof comprises of trivial parts
