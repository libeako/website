* proposition
	* product is associative
* proof
	* (*) := the cartesian product function
	* let s1, s2, s3 be sigma algebras
	* it is enough to prove
		* sigma (s1 * s2 * s3) = sigma (s1 * sigma (s2 * s3))
	* this will be proved by proving the inclusion by one of the other in both direction
	* this trivial lemma will be used
		* proposition
			* forall (x, y : Set)
				* (sigma x <= sigma y) <=> (x <= sigma y)
		* proof is trivial consequence of the fact that the generated sigma-algebra is the minimal one containing the generating set
	* s1 * s2 * s3 <= sigma (s1 * sigma (s2 * s3))
		* proof is trivial
	* s1 * sigma (s2 * s3) <= sigma (s1 * s2 * s3)
		* proof
			* this is intuitive statement, as on the left side the sigma algebra generation is more constrained
			* more formal proof
				* it is enough to prove
					* forall (t in S1)
						* forall (v in sigma (s2 * s3)). (t, fst v, snd v) is in (sigma (s1 * s2 * s3))
						* proof of the immediate above statement
							* L := (sigma (s2 * s3)) constrained by (v -> (t, fst v, snd v) is in (sigma (s1 * s2 * s3)))
							* L = (sigma (s2 * s3))
								* proof
									* L >= (s2 * s3)
										* proof is trivial
									* L is a lambda system
										* see lambda-system
