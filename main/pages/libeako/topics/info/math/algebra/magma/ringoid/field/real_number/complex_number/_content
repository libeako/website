* Complex n := { real : n, imaginary : n }
* n is a type of numbers that form a field; it is usually the real number, but could be rational too
* a short notation of a complex number literal is like a simple pair: (re, im)
* the computational methods
	* (xr, xi) + (yr, yi) := (xr + yr, xi + yi)
	* (xr, xi) * (yr, yi) := (xr * yr - xi * yi, xr * yi + xi * yr)
* embedding
	* _ : n -> Complex n := \ x -> (x, 0)
	* is an embedding of n into Complex n and is a field-homomorphism
	* hence we can use xr as a short notation of (xr, 0)
* a short notation of (0, 1) is i
* a short notation of (0, xi) is (i * xi)
	* this is because:
	* i * xi = (0, 1) * (x1, 0) = (0 * xi - 1 * 0, 0 * 0 + 1 * x1) = (0, xi)
* an other notation of (xr, xi) is (xr + i * xi)
	* this is because:
	* xr + i * xi = (xr, 0) + (0, xi) = (xr, xi)
* (power 2 i) = -1
	* i * i = (0, 1) * (0, 1) = (0 * 0 - 1 * 1, 0 * 1 + 1 * 0) = (-1, 0) = -1
* s * (xr, xi) = (s * xr, s * xi)
	* proof:
		* s * (xr, yr) = (s, 0) * (xr, yr) = (s * xr - 0 * yr, s * yr + 0 * xr) = (s * xr, s * yr)
	* when s = 1
		* 1 * (xr, xi) = (xr, xi)
		* thus 1 is a neutral value in multiplication
* complex numbers form a field
	* proof of associativity of multiplication
		* (x * y) * z =
		* ((xr, xi) * (yr, yi)) * (zr, zi) =
		* (xr * yr - xi * yi, xr * yi + xi * yr) * (zr, zi) =
		* ((xr * yr - xi * yi) * zr - (xr * yi + xi * yr) * zi, (xr * yr - xi * yi) * zi + (xr * yi + xi * yr) * zr) =
		* (xr * yr * zr - xi * yi * zr - xr * yi * zi - xi * yr * zi, - xi * yi * zi + xr * yr * zi + xr * yi * zr + xi * yr * zr)
		* this expression does not change by shuffling x, y, z, hence any other of the multiplication of x, y, z would result in this
	* proof of existence of inverse in multiplication
		* (xr, xi) * (yr, yi) = (1, 0) <=>
		* (xr * yr - xi * yi, xr * yi + xi * yr) = (1, 0) <=>
		* and
			* xr * yr - xi * yi = 1
			* xr * yi + xi * yr = 0
		* rearranged
			* xr * yr - xi * yi = 1
			* xi * yr + xr * yi = 0
		* for each (xr, xi) not = 0. this has exactly 1 solution in (yr, yi)
			* because it is a linear equation system with 2 variables and 2 equations
	* the rest is trivial
* as a metric space complex numbers behave like a 2-dimensional real euclidean space
	* hence the default metric is the euclidean
	* norm x * norm y = norm (x * y)
		* proof
			* it is easier to prove the equality via the square of both sides
			* remember the multiplication of complex numbers
				* (xr, xi) * (yr, yi) := (xr * yr - xi * yi, xr * yi + xi * yr)
				* note that in the result the real and imaginary components are in forms
					* (a - b) and (c + d)
				* their square will contain a middle component
					* (-2 * a * b) and (2 * c * d)
				* in this case these the sum of these is 0
				* hence what remains are the simple squares of a, b, c, d
				* to check the rest is easy
* exp : Complex -> Complex
	* definitions
		* power series
			* with
				* shifted n z := power z n / factorial n
					* -- remember (factorial 0 = 1)
			* fun z -> series (fun n -> shifted (n - 1) z)
