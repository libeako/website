* proposition: Lebesgue integration subsumes Darboux integration
* proof
	* if the integrand is non-negative
		* on 1 dimensional domain
			* take arbitrary non-negative Darboux integrable function f
			* the Darboux sums are simple functions, hence are measurable and their Darboux and Lebesgue integrals are finite and equal
			* consider the set of lower Darboux sums
			* by Darboux integrability of f: exists 2 sequences of Darboux partitionings such that
				* the lower and upper Darboux sums of f on them are monotone
				* let the names of these Darboux approximation function sequences be "fl", "fh"
				* we can make those 2 sequences of Darboux partitionings common
					* by forming the merger of them both with the other sides and with the previous partitionings
					* the mergers refine the partitionings, hence the convergence property is kept
			* (pointwise-limit fl) and (pointwise-limit fh) 
				* exist
					* implied by (fh, fl are monotone)
				* are equal almost everywhere
					* proof
						* condition of Darboux integrability - the lower and higher Darboux approximation integrals converge to each other
							* limit (fl >>> integral) = limit (fh >>> integral)
						* form the difference of the 2 sides of the equality
							* limit (fh - fl >>> integral) = 0
						* by
							* the Fatou lemma
								\ links-to internal ewcysgnuepqzmyyc
							* integral (pointwise-liminf (fh - fl)) <= liminf (fh - fl >>> integral)
						* (fh - fl) monotone decreases, hence the limits exist, hence
							* integral (pointwise-limit (fh - fl)) <= limit (fh - fl >>> integral)
						* by transitivity
							* integral (pointwise-limit (fh - fl)) <= 0
						* hence (pointwise-limit (fh - fl) = 0) almost everywhere
						* hence (pointwise-limit fh = pointwise-limit fl) almost everywhere
				* are measurable
					* proof
						* apply
							* theorem about limits of simple functions

			* f is measurable
				* proof
					* it is squeezed by 2 almost everywhere equal measurable functions
						* see the squeeze theorem
							\ links-to internal lvhilqtghqqjffha
			* hence the Lebesgue integral of f exists
				* and is finite
					* implied by
						* and
							* f being smaller than the upper Darboux sums which are finite
							* the domain of f being bounded
								* the Darboux integral is defined with this constraint
			* the equality between the Lebesgue and Darboux integrals is implied trivially by the squeezing by the Darboux step functions
		* on multi-dimensional domain the proof is the same
	* if the integrand may be negative
		* the positive and negative parts of the integrand are Darboux integrable
			* see theorem

		* apply (the case of the theorem for non-negative integrand, which is already proved) for the positive and negative parts of the integrand individually
