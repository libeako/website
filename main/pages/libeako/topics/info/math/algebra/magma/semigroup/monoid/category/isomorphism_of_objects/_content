* definition: 2 objects [X, Y] in a category are isomorphic iff 2 arrows between them exists and they are inverses of each other
	* formally
		* exist arrows (i : x ~> y), (j : y ~> x) : (((i >>> j) = neutral x) and ((j >>> i) = neutral y))
* if x and y are isomorphic then
	* it is easy to see that arrows {from | to } x have a one-to-one correspondence with arrows {from | to } y; this means that the objects x, y are indistinguishable by their connections with other objects from the category-theoretical point of view; hence in category-theory one often considers a collection of isomorphic objects to be "unique up to isomorphism"
* if the category is (algebras as objects) with (homomorphisms as arrows) then this category-theoretical definition of "isomorphism" corresponds to the algebraic definition of "isomorphism"
