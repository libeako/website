* proposition
	* cos has negative output
* proof
	* suppose the opposite, that cos is non-negative everywhere
	* then
	* slope (slope cos) = slope (sin >>> negate) = cos >>> negate
	* is non-positive everywhere
	* which implies that it is concave
	* bounded concave function is constant
	* but cos is not constant
