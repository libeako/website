* take 2 arbitrary measure spaces
	* (S1, M1, m1)
	* (S2, M2, m2)
* definition: a 'measurable rectangle' is (r1 * r2), where (r1 is in M1) and (r2 is in M2)
* the set of measurable rectangles is a semi-algebra
	* proof is trivial
* in the following "R" will stand for the set of measurable rectangles
* l : R -> Extended NonNegative Real
	* := a1 a2 -> m1 a1 * m2 a2
* l is sigma-additive on R
	* proof

* hence (S, R, l) is a pre-measure-space
* hence (by the (outerish approximation; Carath√©odory extension)) a measure exists on (sigma R) extending l
* if S1 and S2 are sigma-finite then this measure is unique
	* see theorem

* hence the definition of product-measure is
	* if [S1, S2] are sigma-finite then the product-measure is
		* (S1 * S2, sigma (M1 * M2), (unique measure extension of l))
* the product-measure is associative
	* proof
		* the sigma algebra product is associativei

		* proof of the associativity of the measure
			* use the uniqueness of it
