* cos, sin are bounded
	* proof is trivial from (forall x. square (cos x) + square (sin x) = 1)
* cos has positive output value
	* proof: cos 0 = 1
* hence cos is increasing at some 0
* hence cos is not constant
* cos has negative output

* exists x. cos x = 0
	* proof: cas has positive and negative output value
* limit (at 0) (sin / id) = 0
	* proof is trivial usage of
		* L'HÃ´pital's rule

	* this implies that the length of circle is (2 * pi * radius)
		* limit (at zero) (sin / arc length) = 1
