* the usefulness of the Lebesgue integral is not computing it for exotic functions but as a tool for proving theorems

* a function is "integrable" iff it is measurable and the integrals of its positive and negative parts exist
* the integral is defined as the difference between the integrals of the 2 parts
* a function is integrable iff its pointwise norm is integrable

	* proof comprises of trivial parts
* the integral is scalar-multiplicative
	* formally: (lift negate) >>> integral = integral >>> negate
	* proof is trivial
* the integral is additive

* the integral is monotone
	* formally: forall f g. (f <= g) => (integral f <= integral g)
	* proof: integral g - integral f = integral (g - f) >= 0
