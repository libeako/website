* definition
	* iff a set of sets is closed under both
		*        union of countable monotone leniently increasing sets
		* intersection of countable monotone leniently decreasing sets
	* then is is a 'monotone class'
* sigma-algebra <=> (algebra and monotone class)

	* proposition
		* a set of sets is sigma algebra iff it is both an algebra and a monotone class
	* proof is trivial
* the 'monotone class' theorem
