* the Riemann and Darboux representations of the integral are equaivalent; the proof follows
* Riemann => Darboux
	* this proof works with both variants of the Riemann integral
	* the Riemann representation covers the integral with an arbitrarily narrow interval
	* the lower and higher Darboux sums are Riemann sums, hence those too get covered by that narrow interval; those 2 surround the Darboux integral, which hence must be arbitrarily close to the Riemann integral and hence equal to it
* Darboux => Riemann
	* intuitively
		* take a close enough Darboux sum pair with common division D
		* we will show that Riemann sums with fine enough uniform divisions are also close to the Darboux integral
		* take an arbitrary uniform division R which is resolving enough
		* the resolution of R can be big enough so that (the sum of the support sizes of all the sections that contain divisor point of D) is negligable
		* in the rest of the sections: all possible Riamann sums are squezzed by the Darboux sums
	* with more formalism
		* let do > 0 be arbitrary
		* from the existence of the Darboux integral
			* exists division div. do >= distance (the lower Darboux integral, the higher Darboux integral)
			* the integrand is bounded, let m be the supremum of its distance from 0
		* n := the number of division points in div
		* di := do / (n * m * 2))
		* take an arbitrary uniform division dd with section length smaller than di
		* in the sections that contain division point of div
			* the Riemann sum in them < (di * n * m) = do / 2
		* in the other sections the Riemann integral is arbitrarily closely squeezed by the lower and upper Darboud integrals
		* thus do >= distance (Reimann sum on dd, Darboux integral)
