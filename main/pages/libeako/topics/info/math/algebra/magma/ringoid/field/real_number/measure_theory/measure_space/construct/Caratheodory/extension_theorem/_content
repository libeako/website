* proposition
	* if
		* R is an algebra of subsets of T
		* pm is a premeasure on R
		* om : R -> Real
			* outer measure on pm
		* S is the om-Caratheodory-measurable subsets of T
		* cm is restriction of om to S
	* then
		* R <= S
		* cm restricted to R = pm
		* cp is complete
* proof:
	* S is a sigma algebra
		* because it is the Caratheodory-measurable subsets of T
			\ links-to internal dqufiezwzuwwjmeq
	* proving (R <= S)
		* we have to prove
			* forall (x : R). forall (s : Subset of T)
				* cm s >= cm (intersect s x) + cm (intersect s (complementer x))
		* forall e > 0
			* cm s + e
			* >=
				* exists such disjoint covering c of s
			* sum (fun k -> pm (c k))
			* =
				* divide (c k) to 2 parts by x
			* sum (fun k -> pm (union (intersect (c k) x) (intersect (c k) (complementer x))))
			* =
				* implied by pm being countably additive when result is element of R
					* the results of unions here are elemets of R because R is an algebra os sets and these are only binary unions
			* sum (fun k -> pm (intersect (c k) x) +  cm (intersect (c k) (complementer x))
			* =
				* separating the 2 parallel components of the series
					* we can do this because all those components are non-negative
			* sum (fun k -> pm (intersect (c k) x)) + sum (fun k -> pm (intersect (c k) (complementer x)))
			* >=
				* by cm being outer measure on pm
			* cm (intersect s x)) + cm (intersect s (complementer x)))
	* proving (cm restricted to R = pm)
		* take arbitrary (x : R)
		* cm x <= pm x
			* implied by cm being a restriction of an outer measure on pm
		* forall e > 0
			* cm x + e
			* >=
				* exists such disjoint covering (c : Natural -> R) of x, which does not contain anything outside of x
					* each any c set contained some element outside of x then we can intersect it with x [x is element of R]
					* hence (union c = x)
			* sum (c >>> pm)
			* =
				* implied by pm being countably additive if the union is in R
					* in this case the union is in R, because (union c = x)
			* cm (union c) = cm x
	* cp being complete is a consequence of it being a Caratheodory restriction of an outer measure
