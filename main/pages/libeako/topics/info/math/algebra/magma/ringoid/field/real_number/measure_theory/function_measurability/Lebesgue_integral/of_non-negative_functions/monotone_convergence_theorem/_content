* this theorem is a generalization of
	* the same theorem specifically for simple converging functions
		\ links-to internal birkhvgnkzkzupbd
	* and its proof invokes that specific version
* converging functions converge in their integrals too
	* proposition
		* if
			* g : InF
				* all measurable
			* g point-wise-converges to f 
		* then
			* integral f = limit (g >>> integral)
	* proof
		* the measurability of f comes from
			* point-wise limit of measurable functions is measurable

		* by
			* theoream about exists converging function sequence

		* exists h : Nat+ -> Nat+ -> S -> Extended NonNegative Real
			* forall i
				* (h i) is a sequence of non-negative simple functions
				* (h i) converges to (g i)
				* forall n : Nat+. forall x : S. ((g i x - h i n x) <= 1 / power n 2) or (h i n x >= power n 2)
		* j n := h n n
		* j is a sequence of non-negative simple functions
		* forall n. j n <= f
			* implied by the transitivity of (<=)
		* j point-wise converges to f
			* proof
				* take arbitrary (x : S)
				* if (for infinitely many n. j n x = h n n x >= power n 2)
					* then (flip j x) converges to +infinity, hence it converges to (f x)
					* otherwise 
						* for some k. forall n > k. (g n x - j n x) <= 1 / power n 2
						* which implies (flip j x) converges to (g n x), which converges to (f x)
		* l n := the point-wise max of {j i | 0 < i <= n}
		* l inherits all the properties of j already proven and gains that monotone leniently increases
		* thus l has all the conditions that are required by this theorem with the property that contains only simple function
		* hence (integral f = limit (l >>> integral))
		* (forall n. l n <= g n); hence
		* limit (l >>> integral) <= limit (g >>> integral)
		* by transitivity of (<=):
		* integral f <= limit (g >>> integral)
		* the other direction inequality is trivial, as forall n. g n <= f
* the condition (g is increasing) of the theorem is necessary
	* example
		* m := the standard counting measure on the naturals
		* g n x := 
			* if x = n
				* then 1
				* else 0
		* g converges to (constant 0), but all g have integral value 1
