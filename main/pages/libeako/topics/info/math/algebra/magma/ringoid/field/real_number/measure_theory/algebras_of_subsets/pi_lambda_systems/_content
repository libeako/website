* 'pi-system'
	* definition
		* an variety of non-empty algebras of subsets which is closed under non-empty finite intersections
	* 'smallest' or 'generated' pi-system
		* proposition
			* forall set s of subset
				* the intersection of all pi-systems containing s is a pi-system; it is the smallest such pi-system and is comprised by all the non-empty finite intersections among elements of s
			* the proof is trivial
* lambda-system
	* definition
		* multiple variants
			* 1: same as sigma-algebra, except that the union ability is on disjoint subsets only
			* 2
				* S : Set
					* not empty
				* (L : Set (Subset of S)) is lambda-system iff
					* and
						* full : L
						* forall (x y : L). x <= y => (y - x) : L
						* forall (x : Nat+ -> L). x is monotone leniently increasing => (union x) : L
		* proof of equivalence is trivial
	* lambda system is sigma-algebra
		* proof is trivial consequence of definition 1 of lambda-system
	* forall s subset of S. intersection of lambda-systems containing S is a lambda-system
		* proof is trivial via the definition 2 of lambda-systems
		* hence a minimal one of them exists
			* it is said to be the lambda-system 'generated by' s
			* lambda x := the lambda-system generated by x
* sigma-algebra <=> (lamda-system and pi-system)
	* sigma-algebra => (pi-system and lambda-system)
		* proof is trivial
	* (pi-system and lambda-system) => sigma-algebra
		* proofs
			* 1
				* (by having complementer) (from having finite intersections) we (have finite unions)
				* getting countable unions
					* convert the sequence of subsets to union into an ascending sequence of subsets with the same set union
					* lambda-system has ascending countable union
			* 2
				* take arbitrary (L : Set (Subset of S))
				* we need the union-ability of potentially joint subsets; for that we form disjoint version of them with the same union
				* take arbitrary (x : Nat+ -> L)
				* y n :=
					* branch on n
						* 1 -> x 1
						* n -> intersect {(x n), complement (x (n - 1))}
				* y _ : L
				* y is disjoint
				* union x = union y
