* Darboux theorem [existence of intermediate value of slope]
	* proposition
		* if
			* real interval I
			* F : I -> R, has slope
			* a < b
			* {a .. b} <= I
			* slope f a < s < slope f b
		* then
			* exists m
				* a < m < b
				* slope f m = s
	* proof
		* it is easy to reduce the theorem to the special case when (s = 0)
			* then 
				* slope f a < 0 < slope f b
		* f takes both extremums on [a, b]
			* neither of them can be at a or at b becuase there the slope is not zero
			* hence f takes its extremums in the interior of [a, b]
