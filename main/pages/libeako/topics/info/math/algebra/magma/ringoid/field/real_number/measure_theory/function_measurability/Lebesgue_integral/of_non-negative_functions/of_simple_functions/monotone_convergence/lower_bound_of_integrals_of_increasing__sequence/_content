* g : InF
* constant function
	* proposition
		* if
			* l : Real
			* limit g >= constant l
		* then
			* limit (g >>> integral) >= m S * l
	* proof
		* take arbitrary k < l
		* where-above : (S -> Extended Real) -> SubsetOf S
			* := (lift (>= k)) >>> from-predicate-to-set >>> intersect p
		* q := g >>> where-above
			* q is monotone leniently increasing
			* the limit of q-s is S, as g reaches k at every point of S at some place in the sequence
		* apply
			* the continuity of measure
				* \ links-to internal ifslvryguaturinf
			* to deduce
		* m (limit q) = limit (q >>> m)
		* hence forall (e : Real+). exists n : Nat+ -> m (q n) > m S - e
		* hence (integral (g n) >= m (q n) * k >= (m S - e) * k)
		* (e is arbitrarily close to 0) and (k is arbitrarily close to l)
		* hence (limit (g >>> integral)) >= m S * l
* simple function
	* similarly to the previous theorem, but make the limit a simple function on the whole space instead of a constant on a measurable subset
	* proof is trivial, just traverse the base sets of the limiting function [where it is a constant] and for each of them use the previous theorem
