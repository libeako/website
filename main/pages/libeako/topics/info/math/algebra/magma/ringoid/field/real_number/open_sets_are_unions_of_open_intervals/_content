* proposition
	* in a multidimensional Real space each open set is a countable union of open intervals
	* in the 1 dimensional case this union is disjoint
* proof
	* take an arbitrary open set S
	* ointis x := open interval ["brick"] neighborhoods of x (totally in S) (with rational bounds)
		* is not empty
			* proof
				* x has an open-ball neighborhood totally in S
					* by the definition of 'open set's in euclidean spaces
				* open-ball intervals contain some brick neighbohoods with rational bounds
	* gointis :=
		* in the multi-dimensional case
			* choose any non-empty neighborhood
		* in the 1 dimensional case
			* ointis >>> union
				* the greatest such neighborhood is the union of such neighborhoods
				* these being the greatest ones implies that they are disjoint [the union of any intersecting pair would be a greater one]
	* K := lift (gointis) S
		* the set of all greatest open-interval neighborhoods by points of S
	* K = S
		* K <= S
			* as it is the union of sets that are included by S
		* K >= S
			* as it is the union of neighborhoods of each element of S
	* each bound of each of these gathered open intervals is rational; hence they are countably many
