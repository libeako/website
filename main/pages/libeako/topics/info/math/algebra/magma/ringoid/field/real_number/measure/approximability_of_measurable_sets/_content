* proposition in 1 dimensional space
	* measurable sets are approximable in measure by
		* and
			* an open set from the outisde 
			* a closed set from the inside 
	* formally
		* if
			* M : L
		* then forall e > 0
			* and
				* exists open   (A : L). l (A \ M) < e
				* exists closed (A : L). l (M \ A) < e
	* proof
		* open approximation
			* in case (l M) is
				* finite
					* we are in the Lebesgue space, which is an outer measure construction on the semi-algebra R of half-open intervals including the corner cases; hence
						* foreach ec > 0. exists (C : Nat+ -> R) covering of M. sum (C >>> l) - l M < ec
					* A := union C
					* extend these covering intervals to be open on their right sides too; but only with infinitesimally small amount and the sum of the extensions lenghts should be smaller than ec
					* ec := e / 2
				* infinite
					* divide the Real space to [z .. z+1) subintervals; their count is countable
					* foreach of them. apply the already proven finite case with such e values that their sum is smaller than the e in this case of the proof
		* closed approximation
			* apply the open case of this proof to (Real \ M)
* this same proposition and its proof works for multi-dimensional cases too
