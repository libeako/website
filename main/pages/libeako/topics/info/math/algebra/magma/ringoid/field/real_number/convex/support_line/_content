* a "support line" of a function f is a linear function that contains at least 1 boundary point and zero interior points of the epigraph of f
* intuitively the epigraph rests on the support line
* equivalence of existing of all support lines
	* proposition
		* if
			* interval I <= Real
			* f : I -> Real
		* then
			* are equivalent
				* f is convex
				* f has support line everywhere
	* proof
		* =>
			* take arbitrary point c
			* proof 1
				* the line containing (c, f c) and having slope (slope f c) is a support line
					* proof
						* the slope of the left -secant lines to c <= slope f c
						* the slope of the right-secant lines to c >= slope f c
			* proof 2
				* g x := f x - slope f c * x
					* slope g = slope f - slope f c
					* => slope g c = 0
				* by a previous theorem: g attains its minimum at c
				* hence relation (g, const (g c)) = Support
				* hence relation (f, (const (g c) + (slope f c *))) = Support
		* <= by contradiction
			* suppose f is not convex
			* then exist a < c < b. secant-slope (a, c) > secant-slope (c, b)
			* support line of f at c is not possible
