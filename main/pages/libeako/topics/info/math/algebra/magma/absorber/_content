* a "left-absorber" value of a binary function f is 'al' iff
	* forall x. f al x = x
* a "right-absorber" value of a binary function f is 'ar' iff
	* forall x. f x ar = x
* an "absorber" value is one that is both left- and right-absorber
* the words "absorber" and "absorbing" and "zero" are all used for this concept
* absorber values are unique
	* proof
		* suppose a1, a2 are identities
		* then a1 = f a1 a2 = a2
