* "improper integral"
	* meaning: limit of proper integrals
	* name: instead of "proper" and "improper" i would like "raw" and "extended"

* integral f (a, a) = 0
* integral f (a, b) + integral f (b, c) = integral f (a, c)
* integral (f >>> ( * k)) = k * integral f
* integral (lift2 (+) f g) = integral f + integral g
* (forall x. f x <= g x) => lift 2 (<) (integral f) (integral g)
* continuity => integrability
	* proof
		* the domain being compact => continuity => uniform continuity
