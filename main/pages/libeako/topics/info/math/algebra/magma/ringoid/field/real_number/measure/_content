* m is sigma-additive for those cases when the union result is in R
	* proof
		* take arbitrary (s : Nat -> R) such that R contains (union s)
		* we have to prove
			* m (union s) = sum (s >>> m)
		* >=
			* foreach (n : Nat). m (union s) >= sum (from 1 to n) (s >>> m)
			* the comparison is true for the limit too
		* <=
			* the main structure of the proof is branching on the finiteness of (m (union  s))
				* finite
					* foreach (n : Nat). m (s n) is finite
					* take arbitrary e (> 0)
					* create a new sequence of sets which is a slight increase of the originals
						* foreach (n : Nat). (a .. b] -> (a .. b + (e / power n 2))
					* this new sequence is bigger, hence also covers (union s)
					* the members of this new sequence are open - this was the goal
					* change (union s) too
						* again, by moving an end of it by e
						* but move the other [lower] end to make the interval closed
						* move it inside, thus decreasing the interval
					* we can apply compactness
						* the decrease (union s) is covered by the increased s sequence
						* the decreased (union s) is compact
							* implied by it beeing closed
								\ links-to internal sqmtczrxlolvnfsu
						* the covering increased s members are open
						* this is an open covering of a compact set
						* such contains a finite subcover
							* by definition of compactness
						* being finite sequence: we can apply additivity
							* m (union s) - e <= sum (s >>> m) + e
						* e is taken arbitrarily, hence the comparison is true for vanishing e too
							* m (union s) <= sum (s >>> m)
				* infinite
					* we prove this by using the finite case
					* the key is the forming of intervals
						* c (n : Nat) := (-n .. n]
					* it is also key to observe
						* limit (at infinity) (c >>> intersect (union s) >>> m) = infinity
							* to see this observe that (after the sequence achived all finite boundaries of (union s)) the increments in the [measure] result is non-decreasing
					* applying the finite case of the proof
						* foreach (n : Nat). m (intersect (union s) (c n)) <= sum (s >>> intersect (c n) >>> m)
					* we can drop (intersect (c n)) from the side side
						* foreach (n : Nat). m (intersect (union s) (c n)) <= sum (s >>> m)
					* the comparison is true for the limit too
						* limit (n -> m (intersect (union s) (c n))) <= sum (s >>> m)
					* using that that limit value is infinite
						* infinite <= sum (s >>> m)
					* hence
						* m (union s) = sum (s >>> m)
* because of this additivity
	* we can build a measure space from (R, m)

	* borders of intervals are measurable
		* proof
			* their complements are countably unions of measurable intervals
	* hence all intervals are measurable
	* all open sets are measurable
		* proof
			* they are countable unions of intervals
