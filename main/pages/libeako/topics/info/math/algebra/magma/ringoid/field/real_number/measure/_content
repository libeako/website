	* this is the Lebesgue measure space
		* i may use the notation '(Real, L, l)' for it
* multiple dimensions
	* everything before here easily generalizes to multi-dimensionsional intervals
	* it is also possible to define the multi-dimensional Lebesuge space as
		* the completion

	* borders of intervals are measurable
		* proof
			* their complements are countably unions of measurable intervals
	* hence all intervals are measurable
	* all open sets are measurable
		* proof
			* they are countable unions of intervals
				\ links-to internal tfudbcvhnmhualxa
		* hence all closed sets are measurable too
