	* proposition
		* forall (1-distribution w) (point x). f (dp w x) <= dp w (lift f x)
		* equality => (x is constant) or (f is linear)
	* Jensen ineqaulity is equivalent to the special 2-point version of it [when (the number of points = 2)]
		* proof is by induction
* linear parametric sum is equivalent to (weighed-sum in 2 dimensions)
	* lps p (x, y) := p * x + (1 - p) * y
* a function f is convex iff its epigraph is convex
* "secant graph inequality"
	* forall x y. forall p in [0, 1]. f (lps p (x, y)) <= lps p (f x, f y)
		* this is equivalent to the 2-point version of the Jensen inequality
	* this is equivalent to being convex
		* replacing <= with < we get the equivalent correspondent of being strictly convex
		* the proof is easy
	* f is "concave" iff -f is convex
* secant-line f (x, y) := lift (flip lps ((x, f x), (y, f y))) [0, 1]

			* 2-secant variant
				* secant-slope (a, x) <= secant-slope (a, b)
			* 3-secant variant
				* secant-slope (a, x) <= secant-slope (a, b) <= secant-slope (x, b)
* the 2 variants of the secant inequalities are equivalent to being convex
	* replacing <= with < we get the equivalent correspondent of being strictly convex

	* describes the relationship of a linear function to a function
* FLine := (Function, LinearFunction)
	* a pair type of functions
	* interpret summation, multiplication on FLine component-wise
* relation (f : Function) (lf : LinearFunction)
	* | f is strictly above lf everywhere = Below
	* | some of f is strictly below lf    = Secant
	* otherwise                           = Support
* relation is retained by summation and by multiplication by positive number; proof is easy
	* proof: use that these functions are strictly monotone and retain linearity of functions
	* corollary: these functions retain convexity
* all (Real -> Real) convex functions are Lipschitz on any closed sub-interval of the interiors of their domains
	* see Lipschitz function

	* the theorem proposes the convexity only on the closed sub-intervals; hence at the ends of the interval we have a gap to play with, which makes the proof easy
	* consequence: (f : I -> Real), I is open interval => f is continuous
		* proof: f is continuous at every point
			* proof: every point is contained by a closed interval which is inside the domain; on that inside closed interval the function is Lipschitz
* theorem: f is convex <=> (slope f) monotone increases
	* proof
		* => use secant inequality

* theorem: f has second speed => (f is convex <=> speed (speed f) >= 0)
	* proof
		* by a previous theorem
			* f is convex <=> (speed f) monotone increases
			* g monotone increases <=> speed g >= 0
				* g := speed f
* theorem: convex speedy function is continuously speedy
	* proof
		* by a previous theorem
			* convexity => the function monotone increases
		* assume that the speed is not continuous; then
		* must have a jump somewhere; that jump leaves a gap in the image, which nowhere gets filled because of the monotoneness of the speed
		* but it must be filled becasue of the
			* Darboux theorem

	* proposition
		* if
			* interval I <= Real
			* f : I -> R, convex, has speed 
			* {c} <= I
			* speed f c = 0
		* then
			* c is a minimum-place
			* c is a strict minimum place, except some constant neighborhood
	* proof is easy
		* one possible tactic is by contradiction and using the mean value theorem
		* other easy proof is possible too
