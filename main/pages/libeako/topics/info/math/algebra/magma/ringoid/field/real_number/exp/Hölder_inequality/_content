* proposition
	* if
		* F field (Real or Complex)
		* S : Set
			* with measure
		* n : Nat+
		* f : [1 .. n] -> S -> F
			* each measurable
		* p : [1 .. n] -> [1 .. infinite]
			* sum (p >>> (1/)) = 1
	* then
		* norm 1 (product f) <= product (lift2 (norm p) f)
* proof
	* if exists k. norm (p k) (f k) = 0
		* then (f k) = 0 almost everywhere and hence (the left side of the inequality to prove = 0)
	* hence we can continue with the assumption
		* forall k. norm (p k) (f k) >= 0
	* hence we can form
		* r : [1 .. n] -> F
			* := k s -> norm 1 (f k s) / norm (p k) (f k)
	* note
		* forall k
			* integral (power (p k) (r k)) = 1
				* implied by
					* integral (s -> power (p k) (norm 1 (f k s))) = power (p k) (norm (p k) (f k))
	* if exists k. norm (p k) (f k) = infinite
		* then (the right side of the inequality to prove) = infinity
	* hence we can continue with the assumption
		* forall k. norm (p k) (f k) is in (0 .. infinity)
	* if exists k. p k = infinity
		* then
			* norm 1 (f k) <= norm (p k) (f k)
		* and (the inequality to prove) for the rest of the components can be proved with induction on n
	* hence we can continue with the assumption
		* forall k. (p k) is in (1 .. infinity)
	* by
		* the Young inequality
			\ links-to internal clwougymsfpqoakn
		* we have
			* forall (s : S)
				* product r s <= sum (k -> power (p k) (r k s) / (p k))
		* this will be integrated
	* norm 1 (product f) / product (lift2 norm p f)
	* <=
		* by the result from the Young inequality
	* sum (integral (flip r s / p))
	* =
		* implied by an earlier note about the integral of r
	* sum (const 1 / p)
	* =
