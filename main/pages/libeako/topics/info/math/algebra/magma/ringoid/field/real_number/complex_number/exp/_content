* this builds on
	* factorial 0 = 1
* exp : Complex -> Complex
	* definitions
		* as power series
			* z -> series-from 0 (n -> power n z / factorial n)
			* this is valid definition, as this series converges
				* this proposition is a special case of
					* power series over factorial

	* this property is unique
		* proposition
			* if (slope f = f) then exists c. f = c * exp
		* proof
			* r := f / exp
			* slope r = (slope f * exp - f * slope exp) / power 2 exp = 0
				* see slope of division

* exp (x + y) = exp x * exp y
	* proof
		* all of the series here converge absolutely; hence it is enough to prove that all components of the summation of one side are present at the other side too - this being true is easy to see
* trigonometry
