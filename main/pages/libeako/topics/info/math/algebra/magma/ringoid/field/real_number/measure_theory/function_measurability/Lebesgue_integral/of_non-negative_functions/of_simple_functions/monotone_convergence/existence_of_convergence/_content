* proposition
	* exists g : InF
		* all measurable
		* g point-wise-converges to f
		* forall n : Nat+
			* with
				* h := flip power 2
				* forall x : S. (norm (f x - g n x) <= 1 / n) or (g n x > h n)
* proof
	* plan
		* construct partitions of the codomain with ever increasing resolution
		* consider the inverse images of the partition members; they are measurable, because f is measurable
		* construct the searched function so that it is a simple function with this base partitioning of its domain; for each partition. map the lower end of the corresponding codomain interval
		* for each codomain interval
			* the size of the interval is a limit of the difference between the f and the constructed approximator function; but that size is decreasing tas the resolution of the partitioning increases
	* we devide the codomain to 2 parts, becasue the infinity case needs to be handled differently
		* [0 .. h n)
		* [h n .. +infinity]
	* we further divide the first partition to sub-partitions each with length (1 / h n)
		* hence the number of such sub-partition is (power 2 (h n))
	* as n converges to infinity
		* h converges to infinity [the first part covers every finite value eventually]
		* the resolution of the first part grows
	* D k := lift (inverse f) (k-th subpartition of the codomain)
		* is measurable, because f is measurable
	* DD := lift (inverse f) [h n .. +infinity]
		* is measurable, because f is measurable
	* g x :=
		* +
			* sum (lift (k -> (k / h n) * indicator-function-of (D k)) [0 .. h n))
			* h n * indicator-function-of DD
