	* "premeasure"
		* definition
			* a function f : S -> [0 .. +infinity], such that
				* S is an algebra of subsets of the base set
				* countable additivity for the cases when the result of the union is element of S
		* additivity here contains nullary additivity
			* a consequence: (f {} = 0)
		* from finitely additive semi-algebra

	* "measure" := premeasure such that S is sigma algebra
* "measure space" (T, S, m)
	\ id koelzeepineavtuc
	* T is the base set
	* S is a set of subsets of T, a sigma-algebra
	* m is a measure
* (T, S) is a "measurable space"
* a "probability measure" maps the full set to 1
