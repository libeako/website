* this builds on
	* extending a generating an algebra from a semi-algebra of subsets

* proposition
	* if
		* (S : Set) - the space
		* P : Set (Subset of S)
			* semi-algebra of sets
				\ links-to internal norbzvwtmfnxravy
		* R - the algebra generated by R
		* (l : P -> Extended NonNegative Real)
			* countably additive
	* then
		* l has a unique countably additive extension to R
* proof
	* take an arbitrary (s : P)
	* by 
		* the theorem about the generated algabra
			\ links-to internal xmqxkenntcxfmmtl
	* s must be a union of elements of P
	* in order to keep the countable additivity of l: its extension must map to s the sum of the sizes of those elements
	* the problem is that we do not have that the union is unique
	* assume 2 unions exist: x, y : Nat+ -> Extended NonNegative Real
		* union x = s = union y
	* it is enough to prove
		* sum (x >>> l) = sum (y >>> l) 
	* so i will do
	* sum (x >>> l)
	* =
		* implied by (s >= x _)
	* sum (x >>> intersect-with s >>> l)
	* =
	* sum (x >>> intersect-with (union y) >>> l)
	* =
	* sum (n -> l (intersect {x n, union y}))
	* =
	* sum (n -> l (intersect {x n, union (m -> y m)}))
	* =
	* sum (n -> l (union (m -> intersect {x n,y m})))
	* =
		* implied by the conjunction of
			* intersect {x n,y m} is in P
				* implied by P being a semi-algebra
			* l being countably additive
	* sum (n -> sum (m -> l (intersect {x n, y m}))
	* =
		* implied by l being non-negative
	* sum (m -> sum (n -> l (intersect {x n, y m}))
	* ... -- same in the opposite direction till
	* =
	* sum (y >>> l)
