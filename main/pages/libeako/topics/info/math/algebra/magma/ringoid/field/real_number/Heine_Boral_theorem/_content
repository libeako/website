* proposition: in Euclidean spaces: compact <=> closed and bounded
	* proof
		* =>
			* closed
				\ links-to internal ovahhnvgqgtywtlu
			* bounded
				\ links-to internal luiynasvgjfttrnw
		* <=
			* take a closed and bounded set and a sequence in it
			* bounded sequence contains convergent subsequence
				\ links-to internal tjtxwinuamfxqvwp
			* the set is closed, hence contains the limit point
			* hence the set is compact
