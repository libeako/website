* meaning
	* let
		* i 1 : = {interval [0, 1]}
		* i (n + 1) := the first and last third of all the intervals in (i n)
	* the intersection of all i
* legacy
	* was perhaps really discovered by Henry John Stephen Smith
* is closed
	* as it is intersection of closed sets
* has no isolated point
	* easy to prove
* has continuum number of points
	* proof
		* the points of it are those that (are in [0, 1]) and (in a 3-ary digit system lack digit 1)
		* hence they are in bijection with the the ones that (are in [0, 1]) and (in a 2-ary digit system can be any)
		* thus a bijection exist between the Cantor set and interval [0, 1]
* the size is zero
	* as it gets to its 2/3 at every iteration
