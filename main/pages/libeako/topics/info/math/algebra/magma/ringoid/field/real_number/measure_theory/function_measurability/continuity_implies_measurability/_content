* proof
	* take arbitrary
		* (t, b, _) measure space
			* t topological space
			* b contains the Borel sigma algebra of t
		* f : t -> Real
			* continuous
		* l : Real
	* measurability by definition is implied by 
		* foreach open set s. (inverse f s) is measurable
	* inverse image of open set is open

	* open sets are in the Borel sigma algebra and hence (by assumption) in b, hence open sets are measurable
