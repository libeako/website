* if
	* f, g : S -> Extended Real
		* measurable
* then
	* forall (c : Real). (c * f) is measurable
		* proof is trivial
	* negate f is measurable
		* proof is trivial
	* reciproc
		* proof is easy, as of negation, but somewhat complicated with branching over negativity
	* (f + g) is measurable
		* proof
			* fpgst l := keep (f + g < const l) Real
			* take arbitrary (l : Real)
			* we will prove that (fpgst l) is measurable
			* fpgst l
			* =
				* change to countable rational limits
			* union (lift fpgst (keep (< l) rational))
			* countable union of measurable sets is measurable; hence we need to prove only
				* foreach (lr : Rational). (fpgst lr) is measurable
			* foreach (x : Real)
				* (f x + g x) < lr)
				* =
				* or {foreach (fr gr : Rational) where (fr + gr < lr) and (f x < fr and g x < gr)}
	* (f * g) is measurable
		* proof
			* f * g = (power 2 (f + g) - (power 2 f + power 2 g)) / 2
				* thisis continuous because (power _) is continuous
