* proposition
	* if
		* interval [a, b]
		* functions f, g, with slope
	* then
		* g (f b) - g (f a) = integrate ((f >>> slope g) * slope f) [a, b]
* proof
	* the chain rule of slopes
		* slope (f >>> g) = (f >>> slope g) * slope f
	* take the integral of both sides
	* (f >>> g) b - (f >>> g) a = integrate ((f >>> slope g) * slope f) [a, b]
