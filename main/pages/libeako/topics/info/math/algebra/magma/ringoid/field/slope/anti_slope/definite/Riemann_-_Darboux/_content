* integral f (a, a) = 0
* integral f (a, b) + integral f (b, c) = integral f (a, c)
* integral (f >>> ( * k)) = k * integral f
* integral (lift2 (+) f g) = integral f + integral g
* (forall x. f x <= g x) => lift 2 (<) (integral f) (integral g)
* f is integrable => (f >>> norm) is integrable

	* integrability is about tightness of oscillation of f
	* norm decreases the oscillation
		* forall x, y
			* norm (norm (f x) - norm (f y)) <= norm (f x - f y)
* f is integrable => f+ and f- are integrable
