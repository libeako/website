* this part is about 'the monotone class theorem'
* proposition
	* if
		* (S : Set) - the space
		* A : Set (Subset of S)
			* subset algebra
		* mc : Set (SubSet of S) -> Set (SubSet of S)
			* the minimal monotone class including the input
	* then
		* mc A = sigma A
* proof
	* * mc A <= sigma A
		* implied by all monotone classes being sigma algebras
	* * mc A >= sigma A
		* it is enough to prove that (mc A) is a sigma algebra; so i will do
		* it is enough to prove that (mc A) is an algebra
			* implied by
				* sigma-algebra <= (algebra and monotone class)

		* so i will do
		* it is enough to prove that (mc A) is closed under difference, intersection; so i will do
		* the trick is to fix one of the inputs of these functions
		* F y : mc A -> Subset of (mc A) :=
			* (mc A) constrained by
			* x -> {x - y, y - x, intersect x y} <= mc A
		* a symmetry of F
			* forall x, y in (mc A)
				* x is in (F y) <=> y is in (F x)
		* forall y in (mc A)
			* F y = mc A
				* F y <= mc A
					* trivial from the definition of F
				* F y >= mc A
					* enough to prove the conjunction of
						* (F y) is monotone class
							* proof is trivial
						* (F y) >= A
							* proof
								* take arbitrary a in A
								* F a >= A
									* proof is trivial by the definition of F
								* F a >= mc A
									* implied by the conjunction of
										* (F a) is a monotone class
											* implied by the conjunction of
												* forall x in (mc A). (F x) is monotone class
													* this is already proved
												* mc A >= A
										* and (mc A) is the smallest monotone class
								* hence

								* hence by symmetry of F

		* hence (mc A) is an algebra
