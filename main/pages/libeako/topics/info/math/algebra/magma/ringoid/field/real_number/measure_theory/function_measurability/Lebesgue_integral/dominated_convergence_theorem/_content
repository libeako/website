* proposition
	* if
		* f : Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real
			* pointwise convergent
			* all measurable
		* g : S -> NonNegative Extended Real
			* integrable
		* forall (n : Nat+). norm (f n) <= g
	* then
		* integral (pointwise-limit f) = limit (f >>> integral)
* proof
	* by
		* the theorem about the measurability of limit of sequence of measurable functions
			\ links-to internal ubpcmljjbniytygd
		* we get that (pointwise-limit f) is measurable
	* the integrability of (pointwise-limit f) is implied by it being dominated by g
	* this theorem is a generalization of the
		* Fatou lemma
			\ links-to internal ewcysgnuepqzmyyc
		* which
			* has the additional condition which is that the functions in the sequence are non-negative
				* this can be remedied by shifting our functions upward by any function that is high engough to do the shift above zero everywhere
				* this is why this theorem requires 'g'
			* its conclusion is for 'liminf' instead of 'limit'
				* this can be remedied by invoking the lemma from both sides [normally and in opposite direction]
	* with this in mind we get the following statements from the Fatou lemma
		* integral (g + pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (g + f >>> integral)
		* integral (g - pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (g - f >>> integral)
	* we need g no longer
		* integral (g + pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (g + f >>> integral)
		* integral (g - pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (g - f >>> integral)
	* get rid of the negativities
		* integral (pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (f >>> integral)
		* integral (pointwise-liminf f) >= limsup (f >>> integral)
	* by combining these 2 inequalities by the transitivity of the inequality we get the conclusion of this theorem
