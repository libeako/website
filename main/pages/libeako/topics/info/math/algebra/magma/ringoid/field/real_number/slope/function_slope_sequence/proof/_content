* proof of convergence of fn everywhere
	* t := the point where f is convergent
	* take arbitrary x point; i will prove that fn is convergent at x
	* the convergence will be proved by the Cauchy condition
	* forall m n
		* fn m x - fn n x
		* = 
		* (fn m - fn n) x - (fn m - fn n) t + (fn m - fn n) t
		* ((fn m - fn n) x - (fn m - fn n) t) + (fn m - fn n) t
		* =
			* the mean value theorem
				\ links-to internal fspresemhcnedkhm
			* gives such t, q
		* slope (fn m - fn n) (t (m, n) x) + (fn m - fn n) t
		* the first term converges to 0
			* implied by the convergence of fn at t, which is a condition of this theorem
* f := limit fn
* fs := limit (fn >>> slope)
* this builds on
	* the mean value theorem

* we will prove: forall t. (norm (slope f t - fs t)) = 0
* slope f t - fs t
* =
	* by definition of slope
* limit (at x = t) ((f x - f t) / (x - t)) - fs t
* =
	* by using convergence of fn to f
* limit (at x = t) (limit ((fn n x - fn n t) / (x - t)) - fs t)
* =
	* by introducing (m n x) (in (x .. t))
		* according to the mean value theorem
		* (fn n x - fn n t) / (x - t) = slope (fn n) (m n x)
* limit (at x = t) (limit (slope (fn n) (m n x)) - fs t)
* =
	* by moving (fs t) into the limit
* limit (at x = t) (limit (slope (fn n) (m n x) - fs t))
* =
	* by adding 0
* limit (at x = t) (limit (slope (fn n) (m n x) - fs (m n x) + fs (m n x) - fs t))
* =
	* distribute limit over (+)
* limit (at x = t) (limit (slope (fn n) (m n x) - fs (m n x)) + limit (fs (m n x) - fs t))
* =
	* limit (slope (fn n) (m n x) - fs (m n x)) = 0
		* implied by the uniform convergence of (fn >>> slope) to fs
			* the uniformity of the convergence is necessary because we both the function [(fn >>> slope) n] and its argument [m n x] depends on n
* limit (at x = t) (0 + limit (fs (m n x) - fs t))
