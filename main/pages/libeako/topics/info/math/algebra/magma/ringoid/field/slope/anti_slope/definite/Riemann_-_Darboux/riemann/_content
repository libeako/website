* a 'Riemann sample' on a division is a set of points, one from each section of the division
* a 'Riemann sum' is
	* sum {forall partition of the division. the function's output at the sample of the section * the volume of the partition}
* definition
	* 2 versions exist
		* both state the existance of some Riemann sums arbitrarily close to the integral value and the adherence of all Riemann sums on all samples of certain kind; the difference is in that kind - (smaller mesh norm) or (refinement of sample)
	* the 'Riemann integral' exists and equals to l iff 
		* forall dy > 0
			* this is where the 2 variants branch
				* variant 'smaller mesh norm'
					* exists dx > 0. forall division d. forall Riemann sum r over d
						* dx >= the max section length of d
						* =>
						* dy >= distance r l
				* variant 'sample refinement'
					* exists sample s
						* forall refinement rs of s
							* forall r (Riemann sum over rs)
								* distance r l <= dy
			* equivalence between the 2 variants
				* smaller mesh norm => sample refinement
					* proof is trivial
						* refined sample have smaller norm
				* sample refinement => smaller mesh norm
					* sample refinement => Darboux integral exists and equals l
					* Darboux integral exists and equals l => smaller mesh norm
						* see equivalence of the Riemann and Darboux representations
