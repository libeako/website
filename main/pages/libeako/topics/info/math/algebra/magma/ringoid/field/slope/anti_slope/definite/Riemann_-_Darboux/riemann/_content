* a 'Riemann sample' on a division is a set of points, one from each section of the division
* a 'Riemann sum' is
	* sum {forall section of the division. the function's output at the sample of the section * the length of the section}
* the 'Riemann integral' exists and equals to l iff 
	* forall dy > 0. exists dx > 0. forall division
		* dx >= the max section length of the division
		* =>
		* dy >= distance (the Riemann sum over that division) l
