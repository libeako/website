* proposition
	* if
		* f : Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real
			* all non-negative, measurable
	* then
		* integral (pointwise-liminf f) <= liminf (f >>> integral)
* proof
	* g n := pointwise-liminf ((+ (n - 1)) >>> f)
	* g is monotone leniently increasing
	* forall n. g n <= f n
	* hence by
		* pointwise-limit of g exists
		* the monotone convergence theorem

		* integral (pointwise-limit g) = limit (g >>> integral)
	*  integral (pointwise-liminf f)
	* =
		* liminf of sequence = supremum of infimums of tails of sequence
	* integral (pointwise-supremum g)
	* =
		* g is monotone increasing
	* integral (pointwise-limit g)
	* =
		* by the monotone convergence theorem
