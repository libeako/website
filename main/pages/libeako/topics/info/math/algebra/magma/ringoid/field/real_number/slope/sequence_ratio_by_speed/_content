* this page is about the L'Hôpital theorem ["L'Hôpital's rule"]
* this theorem is about ratios of limits of function and their slopes at a certain point; let "p" be the name of this point; p can be an infinity too
* the theorem works for 1-sided limits; for the sake of simplicity of the writing: this page is only about the higher-sided limit; the other side is trivial dual
* if not stated otherwise: "lim" means (the higher sided limit at point p)
* some assumptions
	* f, g : [p .. _] -> Real
		* continuous
		* for the whole interior of the domain
			* and
				* both functions have slope
				* (slope g) is not 0
	* or
		* lim f = lim g = 0
		* lim g = (+ or -) infinity
* proposition
	* lim (f / g) = lim (slope f / slope g)
* proof
	* theorem "constrain inheritance"
		* proposition
			* if
				* g does not output 0
				* l : Extended Real
				* f, g : [p .. q)
				* slope f / slope g <= const l
			* then
				* exists r in [p .. q). forall x in [p .. r). f x / g x <= l
		* proof
			* forall x, y in [p .. q). (g x - g y) may not be 0, because (slope g) is never 0
			* hence we can apply the 'mean value theorem'
				* exists s : power 2 [p .. q) -> Real
					* forall x y in [p .. q)
						* (slope f / slope g) (s (x, y)) = (f x - f y) / (g x - g y)
			* hence
				* forall x, y in [p .. q)
					* (f x - f y) / (g x - g y) <= l
			* case (lim f = lim g = 0)
				* take an arbitrary x in [p .. q)
				* as y converges to p: (f y) and (g y) converges to 0
				* hence
					* ((f x - f y) / (g x - g y)) converges to (f x / g x)
				* the former <= l, hence its limit [f x / g x] <= l too
			* case (lim g = (+ or -) infinity)
				* fix y in [p .. q)
				* exists t in [p .. q). forall x in [p .. t]. (g x - g y) / g x > 0
					* because g converges to an infinity
				* hence on [p .. t] we can multiply
					* (f x - f y) / (g x - g y) <= ll
					* by ((g x - g y) / g x)
				* we get
					* (f x - f y) / g x <= l * (g x - g y) / g x
				* from that
					* f x / g x < l * (g x - g y) / g x + f y / g x
				* g converges to an infinity, hence
					* exists r in [p .. t]
						* forall x in [p .. r). f x / g x <= l
		* intuition
			* this (constrain inheritance) theorem gives us condition with which
				* whatever bound (slope f / slope g) has - (f / g) has that bound too on a neighborhood of p
				* this (with the dual of this theorem) implies
					* lim (f / g) / lim (slope f / slope g)
	* hence we only need to proove that on some neighborhood of p g does not output zero
		* g can not output (> 1) 0 values in its domain 
			* if it did then (the mean value theorem) would imply that (slope g) outputs 0 at some point
* though named after L'Hôpital', Bernoulli knew it earlier
* transform problems to l'Hospital form
	* f * g = f / (1 / g)
	* f - g = (1 / g - 1 / f) / (1 / f * g)
	* limit (fun x -> power (g x) (f x)) =
		* limit (fun x -> exp (ln (f x) * (g x))) = 
		* exp (limit (fun x -> ln (f x) * (g x))) =
		* exp (limit (fun x -> ln (f x) / (1 / (g x))))
* applications
	* Taylor series
		* the Wikipedia article
			\ links-to external https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem#Proofs
			* is good
				* both the general discussion and the proofs
					* the first proof is very simple and understandable; i did not read the long proof
				* read the base form and the "mean-value" form of the residual; the proofs of both are easy
