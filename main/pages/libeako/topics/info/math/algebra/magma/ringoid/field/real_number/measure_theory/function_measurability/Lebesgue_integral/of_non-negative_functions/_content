	* is monotone
		* forall f g. (f <= g) => (integral f <= integral g)
			* proof
				* integral g = integral (f + (g - f)) = integral f + integral (g - f)
				* >=
					* implied by (g - f >= 0)
				* integral f
* a non-negative function is "integrable" iff it is measurable and the integral is finite
