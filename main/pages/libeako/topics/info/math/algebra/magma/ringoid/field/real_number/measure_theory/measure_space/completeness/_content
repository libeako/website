* a "null set" is a measurable set with measure 0
* union of finite and countable null sets is null set
	* proof is trivial by the countable additivity of measure
* the "negligable sets" are the subsets of the null sets
	* they do not have to be measurable
	* empty is negligable
	* this name is my invention
* some teachers use 'null set' for negligable sets
* a measure space is "complete" iff all negligable sets are measurable
* finite and countable union of negligable sets are negligable
	* proof is trivial, as all of them are included by some null set and union of finite and countable null sets is null set
* extension of a measure space with the negligable sets
	* take (S, OM, om) measure space
	* CM := (OM, the negligable sets) lifted by union
	* CM is a sigma algebra, the smallest one including both OM and the neglibable sets
		* proof
			* being smallest
				* any sigma algebra including both OM and (the negligable sets) must contain the unions of them
			* being a sigma algebra
				* empty is a member of both OM and the negligable sets
				* proof of closedness under union is trivial
				* complementer
					* take (an s : OM) and (an ns negligable set)
					* we need to prove
						* CM contains (complement (union s ns))
					* n := ns \ s
					* s and n are disjoint
					* union s ns = union s n
					* hence it is enough to prove
						* CM contains (complement (union s n))
					* n is negligable
					* hence exists null set zs : S. zs includes n
					* z := zs \ s
					* z is null set
					* s and z are disjoint
					* z includes n
					* complement (union s n) = union (complement (union s z)) (z \ n)
					* S contains (complement (union s z))
						* implied by (S includes {s, z})
					* (z \ n) is negligable
	* extension of the measure
		* forall (s : OM) (n negligable set). cm (union s n) := om s
			* uniqueness of this definition
				* proposition
					* (union s1 n1 = union s2 n2) => (om s1 = om s2)
				* proof
					* let z1, z2 be null sets including n1, n2
					* s1 <= union s1 n1 = union s2 n2 <= union s2 z2
					* hence 
						* om s1 <= om (union s2 z2) <= om s2 + om z2 = om s2
					* symmetrically: om s2 <= om s1
		* cm is an extension of om
			* proof
				* take arbitrary  (s : OM)
				* cm s
				* =
				* cm (union s empty)
				* =
					* by definition of cm
				* om s
		* cm is a measure
			* proof
				* cm empty = cm (union empty empty) = om empty = 0
				* countable additivity
					* sn : Nat+ -> Set
						* all in CM
						* disjoint
					* sn composes to 2 parallel sequences s and n
					* cm (union sn)
					* =
						* implied by definition of cm
					* om (union s)
					* =
						* implied by
							* om is a measure
							* the components of s are disjoint
								* implied by (the components of sn are disjoint)
					* sum (s >>> om)
					* =
						* cm is an extension of om
					* sum (s >>> cm)
					* =
						* implied by definition of cm
					* sum (sn >>> cm)
		* (S, CM, cm) is complete
			* proof
				* take arbitrary cn cm-negligable set
				* from the cm-negligability of cn: exists (cz : CM). (cz contains cn) and (cm cz = 0)
				* (CM contains cz), hence (exists (s : OM) (sn om-negligable set). cz = union s sn)
				* sn is om-negligable, hence exists (oz : OM). (oz contains sn) and (om oz = 0)
				* cm cz = 0, hence by definition of cm: (om s) = 0
				* cn <= cz = union s sn <= union s oz
				* om (union s oz) <= om s + om oz = 0 + 0 = 0
				* hence cn is om-negligable; hence cn is contained by CM
