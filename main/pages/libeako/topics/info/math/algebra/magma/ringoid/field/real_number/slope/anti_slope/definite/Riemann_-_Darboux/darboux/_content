* the ('lower' | 'higher') Darboux output of a function on an interval is the (infimum | supremum) of the function on that interval
* the 'Darboux sum' is
	* sum {forall section of the division. the function's Darboux output on the section * the lenght of the section}
* the lower Darboux sum <= any Riemann sum <= the higher Darboux sum
* the (lower | higher) Darboux sum is (higher | lower) or equal if the division gets finer
* for any pair of divisions (p, q): the lower Darboux sum on p <= the higher Darboux sum on q
	* proof
		* the lower Darboux sum on p
		* <=
			* because p <= (union p q)
		* the lower Darboux sum on (union p q) <=
			* comparison of lowe and higher Darboux sum on the same division
		* the higher Darboux sum on (union p q)
		* <=
			* because q <= (union p q)
		* the higher Darboux sum on q
* the ('lower' | 'higher') 'Darboux integral' is the (supremum | infimum) over all the divisions of the interval of the (lower | higher) Darboux sum of that interval
* the 'Darboux integral' exists and equals to l iff the higher and lower Darboux integrals equal to l
* existence of the Darboux integral => the function is bounded
