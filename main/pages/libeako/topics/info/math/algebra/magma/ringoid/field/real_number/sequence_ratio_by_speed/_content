* proposition
	* if
		* Real non-empty interval [a, b] 
		* f, g : [a, b] -> Real
			* have slope in the interior of the domain
			* not exist x in internal (a, b). slope g x = 0
		* l : ExtendedReal
		* lim := (limit-low b) or (limit-high a)
			* 'limit-low' and 'limit-high' here intend to be the one-sided limits
		* or
			* lim f = lim g = 0
			* lim g = (+ or -) infinity
		* lim (slope f / slope g) = l
	* then lim (f / g) = l
* proof
	* will prove only (lim = limit-high a), the other side is symmetrical
	* the frame of the proof is
		* if (l < + infinity) then prove
			* forall ll > l. exists c
				* a < c < b
				* forall x. (a < x < c) => f x / g x < ll
		* dually for (l > - infinity)
		* note
			* the conjunction of these 2 proposition squeezes (f/g) into arbitrarily narrow band around L, which implies that (f/g) converges to l
			* this works in the case too when l is an infinity
		* it is enough to prove the (L < + infinity) case, because the proof of its dual is the dual of the proof
	* let lll be in (l, ll)
	* exists cc in (a, c). forall x in (a, d). (slope f x / slope g x) < lll
	* (g x - g y) may not be 0, because (slope g) is never 0
	* hence we can apply the mean value theorem
		* exists s : power 2 (a, cc) -> Real
			* forall x y in (a, cc). (slope f / slope g) (s (x, y)) = (f x - f y) / (g x - g y)
	* hence forall x y in (a, cc). (f x - f y) / (g x - g y) < lll
	* case (lim f = lim g = 0)
		* fix x in (a, cc)
		* as y converges to a: (f y) and (g y) converges to 0
		* hence ((f x - f y) / (g x - g y)) converges to (f x / g x)
		* the former < lll, hence (f x / g x) <= lll < ll
	* case (lim g = (+ or -) infinity)
		* fix y in (a, cc)
		* exists ccc in (a, cc). x < e => ((g x - g y) / g x > 0)
			* because g converges to an infinity
		* hence we can multiply 
			* (f x - f y) / (g x - g y) < lll
			* by ((g x - g y) / g x)
		* we get
			* (f x - f y) / g x < lll * (g x - g y) / g x
		* from that
			* f x / g x < lll * (g x - g y) / g x + f y / g x = lll + (lll * g y + f y) / g x
		* g converges to an infinity, hence (fun x -> ((lll * g y + f y) / g x)) converges to lll
		* hence exists cccc in (a, ccc). x < cccc => f x / g x < lll + (lll + ll) / 2 < ll
* though named after L'HÃ´pital', Bernoulli knew it sooner
