* proposition
	* if
		* s : Subset of T
		* S is the set of measurable subsets of T
		* K is a subset of S, containing at most countable number of elements
	* then
		* m (intersect s (union K)) = sum (lift (intersect s >>> m) K)
* proof is branched according to the number of elements of K
	* 0, 1: trivial

		* proposition
			* if
				* x y : S
					* disjoint
			* then
				* m (intersect s (union x y)) = m (intersect s x) + m (intersect s y)
		* proof
			* m (intersect s (union x y))
			* =
				* implied by x being measurable
			* m (intersect (intersect s (union x y)) x) + m (intersect (intersect s (union x y)) (complementer x))
			* =
			* m (intersect s x) + m (intersect s y)
	* finite: natural induction on case 2
	* countable
		* take
			* xs : Nat -> K
				* disjoint
		* i aim to prove
			* m (intersect s (union xs)) >= sum (fun n -> m (intersect s (xs n)))
				* the other direction is implied by the sub-additivity of m being outerish
			* forall (n : Nat)
				* m (intersect s (union xs))
				* >=
					* implied by monotonicity of outerish measure
				* m (intersect s (union (till n) xs))
				* =
					* implied by the finite version of this theorem
				* sum (till n) (fun n -> m (intersect s (xs n)))
			* hence it is also true for the limit
