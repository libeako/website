* introduction
	* definition
		* category is a very important variety of algebras and homomorphism is a very important type of function, hence homomorphism between categories got a special name: "functor"
	* a functor consists of 2 functions
		* category has 2 sorts [objects, arrows], thus a mapping between categories consists of 2 functions: (one from objects to objects) and (one from arrows to arrows)
