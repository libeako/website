* proposition: Lebesgue integration subsumes Riemann integration
* proof
	* take arbitrary Riemann integrable function f
	* the Riemann sums are simple functions, hence are measurable
	* consider the set of lower Riemann sums
	* by Riemann integrability of f: exists 2 sequences of Riemann partitionings such that
		* the lower and upper Riemann sums of f on them are monotone
		* let the names of these Riemann approximation function sequences be "fl", "fh"
		* we can make those 2 sequences of Riemann partitionings common
			* by forming the merger of them both with the other sides and with the previous partitionings
			* the mergers refine the partitionings, hence the convergence property is kept
		* limit (fl >>> integral) = limit (fh >>> integral)
			* condition of Riemann integrability - the lower and higher Riemann approximation integrals converge to each other
	* form the difference
		* limit (fh - fl >>> integral) = 0
	* by
		* the Fatou lemma
			\ links-to internal ewcysgnuepqzmyyc
		* integral (pointwise-liminf (fh - fl)) <= liminf (fh - fl >>> integral)
	* (fh - fl) monotone decreases, hence the limits exist, hence
		* integral (pointwise-limit (fh - fl)) <= limit (fh - fl >>> integral)
	* by transitivity
		* integral (pointwise-limit (fh - fl)) <= 0
	* hence (pointwise-limit (fh - fl) = 0) almost everywhere
	* because fh, fl are monotone
		* their pointwise-limit exist
		* pointwise-limit (fh - fl) = pointwise-limit fh - pointwise-limit fl
	* applying
		* theorem about limits of simple functions
			\ links-to internal ubpcmljjbniytygd
	* we get that (pointwise-limit fh) and (pointwise-limit fl) are measurable
		* applying
			* the squeeze theorem
				\ links-to internal lvhilqtghqqjffha
			* on (pointwise-limit fh) and (pointwise-limit fl)
		* we get that the function f between them is measurable
	* because of the measurability of (pointwise-limit fh) and (pointwise-limit fl):
		* their Lebesgue integral exists, and by Riemann condition: those integrals are equal
	* hence they squeeze (the Lebesgue integral of f) to be equal to them, that is - to the Riemann integral
