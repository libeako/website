* this is said to be the 'fundamental theorem of calculus'
* proposition
	* let f be a function, continuous on interval [a, b]
	* slope (fun x -> integral f [a, x]) = f
* proof
	* slope (fun x -> integral f [a, x]) - f
	* =
		* by interpreting 'slope'
	* limit (fun h -> (integral f [a, x + h] - integral f [a, x]) / h - f x) 0
	* =
		* by integral over divided interval
	* limit (fun h -> (integral f [x, x + h]) / h - f x) 0
	* =
	* limit (fun h -> (integral f [x, x + h] - h * f x) / h) 0
	* =
		* by intergal of constant function
	* limit (fun h -> (integral f [x, x + h] - integral [x, x + h] (const (f x))) / h) 0
	* = 
	* limit (fun h -> (integral (f - (const (f x))) [x, x + h]) / h) 0
	* =
		* maximize (f - (const (f x))
			* this is possible because f is continuous
		* the norm of the bound is arbitrarily small as h converges to 0
	* 0
