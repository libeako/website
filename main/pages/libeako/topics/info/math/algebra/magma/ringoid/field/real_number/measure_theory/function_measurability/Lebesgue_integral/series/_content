* integration here is on the set of positive natural numbers with the counting measure [which maps sets to their number of elements]
* proposition
	* if
		* f : Nat+ -> Extended Real
	* then
		* sum f = integral f
* proof
	* assume that f is non-negative
		* g : Nat+ -> Nat+ -> Extended Real
			* := n k -> if k <= n then f k else 0
			* thus (g _) is like f but a tail section of it made zero
			* g is monotone leniently increasing
		* sum f = 
		* limit (n -> sum (over [1 .. n]) f) =
		* limit (n -> sum (over [1 .. n]) (g n))
		* =
			* this is a finite summation, hence the equality is trivially true
		* limit (n -> integral (restrict-to ([1 .. n]) g n))
		* =
			* we can drop the restriction, because everywhere else g outputs zero
		* limit (n -> integral (g n))
		* =

		* integral (limit g) = integral f
	* extend to arbitrary f
		* f = f+ + f-
		* apply the non-negative part of this theorem (which is already proved) for each component
