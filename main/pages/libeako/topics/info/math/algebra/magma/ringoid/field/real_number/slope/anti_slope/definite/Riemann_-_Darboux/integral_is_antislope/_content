* this is said to be the 'fundamental theorem of calculus'
* proposition
	* let f be a function, continuous on interval [a, b]
	* slope (x -> integral [a, x] f) = f
* proof
	* slope (x -> integral [a, x] f) - f
	* =
		* by interpreting 'slope'
	* limit (h -> (integral [a, x + h] f - integral [a, x] f) / h - f x) 0
	* =
		* by integral over divided interval
	* limit (h -> (integral [x, x + h] f) / h - f x) 0
	* =
	* limit (h -> (integral [x, x + h] f - h * f x) / h) 0
	* =
		* by intergal of constant function
	* limit (h -> (integral [x, x + h] f - integral [x, x + h] (const (f x))) / h) 0
	* = 
	* limit (h -> (integral [x, x + h] (f - (const (f x)))) / h) 0
	* =
		* maximize (f - (const (f x))
			* this is possible because f is continuous
		* the norm of the bound is arbitrarily small as h converges to 0
	* 0
* a "second" part of the theorem exists too
	* it does not require f to be continuous
	* i omit it because
		* the proof of it is long
		* probably rare to want to use for not coninuous f
