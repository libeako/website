* definition
	* for all categories: reversing all the arrows in it results in a category; the resultant category is named the "dual" of the original category
* dual is involution
	* which means that the dual of the dual is the original [dual >>> dual = id]
		* => each category is the dual of some category
* the "duality principle"
	* is a theorem: if a proposition is true for all categories then the dual of the proposition [the same but the arrows reversed in it] is also true for all categories
		* the proof is trivial, based on the observation that all categories are dual of some category
	* importance
		* all the results in category theory automatically have a dual version for free
