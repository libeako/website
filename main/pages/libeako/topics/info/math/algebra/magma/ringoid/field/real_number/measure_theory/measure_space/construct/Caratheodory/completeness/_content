* 'completeness' of outerish measures construction

	* proposition
		* if m is outerish measure then if (c is negligable) then (c is measurable)
	* proof
		* c is negligable, hence by monotonicity of m: m c = 0
		* forall s : Set
			* m (intersect s (complement c)) + m (intersect s c)
			* =
			* m (intersect s (complement c)) + 0
			* =
			* m (intersect s (complement c))
			* <=
				* implied by the monotonicity of m
			* m s
* the Carathéodory construction produces an outerish measure, which hence is complete
* sigma algebra generation: minimal versus Carathéodory
	* proposition
		* if
			* (S : Set) - a space
			* A : (Algebra of (Subset of S))
			* v : A -> Extended NonNegative Real
				* finitely additive
			* (M : Subset, m : M -> Extended NonNegative Real)
				* the result of the Carathéodory measure construction
			* S is m-sigma-finite
			* V := (sigma A, M restricted by (m >>> (= 0))) lifted by (uncurry (-))
			* U := (sigma A, M restricted by (m >>> (= 0))) lifted by (uncurry union)
		* then
			* V = M = U
	* proof
		* assume (m S < infinity)
			* union V U <= M
				* proof
					* sigma A <= M
					* S restricted by (m >>> (= 0)) <= M
						* implied by m being outerish measure
							* see theorem

			* M <= V
				* proof
					* take arbitrary (x in M)
					* forall e > 0. exists (a in (sigma A))
						* (a >= x) and (m a - m x < e)
							* hence (m (a - x) < e)
					* hence we can construct from these a's a monotone decreasing sequence
						* (a : Nat+ -> sigma A). lim (a >>> (- x) >>> m) = 0
					* by using
						* continuity of measure
							\ links-to internal onfojfiwpsipndoy
					* we get
						* m (lim (a >>> (- x))) = 0
					* l := lim (a >>> (- x))
					* hence (l = intersect a - x)
					* hence
						* m l = 0
						* x = intersect a - l
			* M <= V
				* proof
					* take arbitrary (x in M)
					* use the already proved (M <= V) case on (S - x)
		* otherwise
			* use the theorem condition (S is sigma finite)
