* proposition
	* if (c is negligable) then (c is measurable)
* proof
	* c is negligable, hence by monotonicity of m: m c = 0
	* forall s : Set
		* m (intersect s (complement c)) + m (intersect s c)
		* =
		* m (intersect s (complement c)) + 0
		* =
		* m (intersect s (complement c))
		* <=
			* implied by the monotonicity of m, which is implied by m being an outerish measure
		* m s
