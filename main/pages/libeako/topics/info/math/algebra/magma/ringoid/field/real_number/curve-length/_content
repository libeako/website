* the length of a curve is the supremum of the lengths of the polgyons along it
* when the curve is parametric
	* d : Nat+
		* the number of dimensions
	* a, b : Real
		* a < b
	* f : [a .. b] -> power d Real
		* continuously differentiable
	* proposition
		* length f = integral [a .. b] (slope f >>> norm)
	* proof
		* length f = sup (over all polygon p along f) (length p)
		* the proof of this theorem is an easy application of
			* proposition
				* if
					* p is a concrete polygon along f
				* by keeping halving all its sections
					* the lengths of the resultant polygons
					* converges up to
					* (integral [a .. b] (slope f >>> norm))
			* proof
				* jp n := the position [parameter] of the n-th joint of p
				* length p
				* =
				* sum (for n in [1 .. (number of joints of of p) - 1]) (norm (f (jp (n + 1)) - f (jp n)))
				* =
				* sum (for n in [1 .. (number of joints of p) - 1])
					* *
						* norm (f (jp (n + 1)) - f (jp n)) / (jp (n + 1) - jp n)
						* jp (n + 1) - jp n
				* using
					* the mean value theorem
						\ links-to internal fspresemhcnedkhm
					* norm (f (jp (n + 1)) - f (jp n)) / (jp (n + 1) - jp n)
					* can be replaced by some tuple s of (slope f) components on [jp n .. jp (n + 1)]
						* the different components may be at different parameter, but that will not be a problem
				* the domain of f is compact, hence the continuity of (slope f) is uniform
				* hence by halving the sections of p
					* the length of the maximum section [the 'norm' of the polygon] converges to zero
					* hence s converges to (slope f)
				* the upwardness of the convergence is implied by (finer polygons are longer)
