* anti-slope
	* alternative names - "primitive", "anti-derivative"
	* F is 'anti-slope' of f iff f is slope of F
	* the anti-slope equivalence classes 
		* if F1, F2 are anti-slopes of f then
		* slope (F1 - F2) = 0, on the whole interval
		* hence [by the mean value theorem] (F1 - F2) is constant
		* hence F1 and F2 differ from each other only by a constant addition
* if F is an anti-slope of f then (integral f [a, b] = F b - F a)
	* proof is trivial building on
		* integral is anti-slope
