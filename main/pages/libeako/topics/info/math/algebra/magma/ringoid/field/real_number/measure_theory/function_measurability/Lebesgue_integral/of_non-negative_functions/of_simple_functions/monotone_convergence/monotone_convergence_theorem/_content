* converging functions converge in their integrals too
* proposition
	* if
		* g : Inf
			* all simple
		* g point-wise-converges to f 
	* then
		* integral f = limit (g >>> integral)
* proof
	* the measurability of f comes from
		* point-wise limit of measurable functions is measurable

		* <= is trivial
		* >= is easy
			* take arbitrary simple funcrion h, such that (h <= f)
			* we only need to prove that
				* limit (g >>> integral) >= integral h
			* this is given by
				* theorem about increasing functions reaching limit
