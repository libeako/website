* if
	* (S : Set) - the space
	* A, M, B : Set (Subset of S)
	* A is an algebra
	* (M, m)
		* the Carath√©odory restriction of the outerish extension of some (premeasure on A)
	* (B, b)
		* some measure space on S
	* A <= B <= M
	* on B. b = m
* then
	* b <= m
		* proof
			* take arbitrary (x in B)
			* forall (c : Nat+ -> A) cover of x
				* b x <= sum (c >>> b) = sum (c >>> m)
					* note: (m x) is the infimum of such sums
			* hence b x <= m x
	* forall (a in A). (m a < infinity) => b a = m a
		* proof
			* take arbitrary (a : in A) and assume (m a < infinity)
			* exists (c : Nat+ -> A) cover of a such that
				* sum (c >>> m) < infinity
				* c is disjoint
			* b a + b (c - a) = b (union c) = sum (c >>> b) = sum (c >>> m) = m (union c) = m a + m (c - a)
			* from the previous, proved part
				* forall x in {a, c - a}. b x <= m x
			* hence (b a = m a)
