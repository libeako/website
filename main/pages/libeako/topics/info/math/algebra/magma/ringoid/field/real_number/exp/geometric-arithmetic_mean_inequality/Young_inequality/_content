* Young's inequality is the same as the weighed geometric-arithmetic mean inequality, but the exponent flipped by its reciproc and the power flipped by the variable
	* proposition
		* if
			* reciprocal 1-distribution w
			* non-negative reals x
	* then
		* product x <= sum (lift2 (power w) x / w)
		* equality iff ((lift2 (power w) x) is constant)
	* proofs
		* analogously to the proof of (the weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality), but starting from (the concavity of ln) instead of (the convexity of exp)
		* derived from (the weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality), by doing the 2 flippings
			* from the weighted geometric-arithmetic mean inequality
				* product (lift2 power (1/w) y) <= dot-product (1/w) y
				* equality iff (y is contant)
			* x := lift2 (power (1/w)) y
			* y = lift2 lg (1/w) x = lift2 (power w) x
			* product x
			* <=
			* dot-product (1/w) (lift2 (power w) x)
			* =
			* sum (lift2 (power w) x / w)
