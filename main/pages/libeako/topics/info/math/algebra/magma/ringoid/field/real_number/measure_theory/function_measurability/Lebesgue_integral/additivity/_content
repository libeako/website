* proposition
	* if
		* g h are integrable functions
		* f = where defined (g + h)
	* then
		* f is integrable
		* integral f = integral g + integral h
* proof
	* from (f g are integrable): almost everywhere f g are finite
	* hence almost everywhere
		* f = g + h
		* norm f = norm (g + h) <= norm g + norm h
			* using
				* the theorem about integrability of normed function
					\ links-to internal sndbxfxrzqpoliuz
			* g h are integrable
			* hence (norm g) (norm h) are integrable
			* hence (norm f) is integrable
			* hence f is integrable
		* f+ - h = f- + g
			* hence integral (f+ - h) = integral (f- + g)
			* if (g is non-negative) and (h is non-positive)
				* integral (f+ + (lift negate h)) = integral (f- + g)
				* all the terms here are non-negative, hence by using the additivity of the integral on non-negative functions
				* integral f+ + integral (lift negate h) = integral f- + integral g
				* integral f+ - integral h = integral f- + integral g
				* integral f+ - integral f- = integral g + integral h
				* integral (f+ - f-) = integral g + integral h
				* integral f = integral g + integral h
			* generally
				* intgegral f
				* =
					* almost everywhere the arguments are equal
				* integral (g + h)
				* =
					* by the definition of integral
				* integral ((g+ + h+) - (g- + h-))
				* =
					* making it an integral of an addition
				* integral ((g+ + h+) + (lift negate (g- + h-)))
				* = 
					* by using the already proved case when of the addition one argument is non-negative and the other argument is non-positive
				* integral (g+ + h+) + integral (lift negate (g- + h-)))
				* =
				* integral (g+ + h+) - integral (g- + h-)
				* =
					* using the additivity of the integral on non-negative functions
				* (integral g+ + integral h+) - (integral g- + integral h-)
				* =
				* (integral g+ - integral g-) + (integral h+ - integral h-)
				* =
					* by the definition of integral
				* integral g + integral h
