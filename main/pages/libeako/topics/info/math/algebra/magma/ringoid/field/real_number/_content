* several methods for representing the real numbers are well known
* some representations
	* the symmetric cut representation
		* similar to Dedekind cuts, but is symmetric
		* the representation
			* side-sets : 2 -> (Q -> Prop)
				* the 2 subsets of the rational numbers, to each side from the represented number; they do not contain the represented number
		* a potential improvement is to store only one of the side-sets, but do not fix the side, allow both sides
			* this makes it possible to avoid having to store the 0, which have behavior problem in division
	* with Cauchy sequences
		* the relation
			* \ (x, y : Sequence Rational) -> forall d pozitive rational. exists n0. forall n > n0. abs (x n - y n) < d
		* is an equivalence relation
	* digit sequence
* isomorphism between the symmetric cut and Cauchy representations
	* symmetric cut => Cauchy
		* if the represented number is rational then the case is trivial; else:
		* start with a pair of rational numbers from each side-sets
		* compute the middle between them; it will fall into exactly one of the side-sets; replace the member of the pair with this new rational number
		* continue this without end
		* the resultant sequence is Cauchy and converges to the represented real number
	* symmetric cut <= Cauchy
		* any Cauchy sequence is bounded by a sequence of nested closed intervals whose size converges to zero
		* the end-point-pairs of these intervals determine the side-sets of the symmetric cut rep
* basic properties
	* the metric space of the real numbers is complete
	* the infimum and supremum of all bounded subsets of the real numbers exists
* monotone bounded sequences converge to their extremums
	* proof is trivial application of the extremum existing
* bounded sequences contain convergent subsequence
	* proof 1
		* sequences contains monotone subsequence
		* monotone sequences converge
	* proof 2
		* divide the bounded interval into 2 halves; at least one of them surely contain infinite number of elements of the sequence; continue recursively on it with those elements only; do this without end
	* this extends to multiple dimensional space easily
		* find a convergent subsequence in the first dimension
		* dropping this dimension and the rest of the sequence go back to the previous step
	* this theorem says that the real and complex euclidean spaces are compact
	* a name of this theorem is "Bolzano-Weierstrass"
* intermediate value theorem
	* if f is continuous function then it takes all values from (f a) to (f b) on interval [a, b]
	* proof
		* keep halving the interval on the domain, continue with the half whose end-point values are mapped by f to different sides of the intermediate value
		* the half-point sequence is Cuachy, hence converges; f maps its limit point to the intermediate value, because f is continuous
* the image of a continuous function on an interval is continuous 
	* easy consequence of the intermediate value theorem
* mean value theorems
