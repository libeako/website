* the Riemann and Darboux representations of the integral are equaivalent; the proof follows
* Riemann => Darboux
	* the Riemann representation covers the integral with an arbitrarily narrow interval, by sufficient fineness of the division
	* the lower and higher Darboux sums are Riemann sums, hence those too get covered by that narrow interval; those 2 surround the Darboux integral, which hence must be arbitrarily close to the Riemann integral and hence equal to it
* Darboux => Riemann
	* let do > 0 be arbitrary
	* from the existence of the Darboux integral
		* exists division div. do >= distance (the lower Darboux integral, the higher Darboux integral)
		* the function is bounded, let m be the supremum of its distance from 0
	* n := the number of division points in div
	* di := do / (n * m * 2))
	* take an arbitrary uniform division dd with section length smaller than di
	* in the sections that contain division point of d
		* the Riemann sum in them < (di * n * m) = do / 2
	* in the other sections the Riemann integral is arbitrarily closely squeezed by the lower and upper Darboud integrals
	* thus do >= distance (Reimann sum on dd, Darboux integral)
