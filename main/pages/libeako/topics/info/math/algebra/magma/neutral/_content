* a "left-neutral" value of a binary function f is 'nl' iff
	* forall x. f nl x = x
* a "right-neutral" value of a binary function f is 'nr' iff
	* forall x. f x nr = x
* a "neutral" value is one that is both left- and right-neutral
* the words "neutral" and "identity" are both used for this concept
* neutral values are unique
	* proof
		* suppose n1, n2 are identities
		* then n1 = f n1 n2 = n2
