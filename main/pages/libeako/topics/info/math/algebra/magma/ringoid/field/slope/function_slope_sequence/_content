* proposition
	* if
		* fn : Nat -> Real -> Real
		* forall n. (fn n) has continuous slope
		* fn uniformly converges to f
		* (fun n -> fn n >>> slope) uniformly converges to fs
	* then (fs = slope f)
* proof
	* this builds on
		* the mean value theorem
			\ links-to internal fspresemhcnedkhm
	* we prove: forall d. (norm (slope f d - fs d)) = 0
	* norm (slope f d - fs d)
	* =
		* by definition of slope
	* norm (limit (at x = d) ((f x - f d) / (x - d)) - fs d)
	* =
		* by using  uniform convergence of (fn n) to f as n converges to infinity
			* uniformity is needed because the functions are applied to 2 different value [{x, d}]
	* norm (limit (at x = d) (limit (at n = infinity) ((fn n x - fn n d) / (x - d)) - fs d))
	* =
		* by introducing (k n x) (in the interval from x to d)
			* according to the mean value theorem
			* (fn n x - fn n d) / (x - d) = slope (fn n) (k n x)
	* norm (limit (at x = d) (limit (at n = infinity) (slope (fn n) (k n x)) - fs d))

	* norm (limit (at x = d) (limit (at n = infinity) (slope (fn n) (k n x) - fs d)))
	* =

	* norm (limit (at x = d) (limit (at n = infinity) (slope (fn n) (k n x) - fs (k n x) + fs (k n x) - fs d)))
	* =

	* =
		* limit (at n = infinity) (slope (fn n) (k n x) - fs (k n x)) = 0
			* implied by the uniform convergence of (slope (fn n)) to fs as n converges to infinity
