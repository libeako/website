* the "division" of a real interval [a - b] is represented by a set of point inside it, dividing the interval into sub-intervals
* the length of the biggest sub-interval is said to be the "norm" of the division by some mathematicians
* alternative names
	* "partition"
		* this is wrong name, because it 'set partitioning' means something else; which partition would the dividing points belong?
	* "dissection"
* a divisian x is "finer" than a division y iff as sets of points x > y
