* meaning of "slope"
	* let T be a metric field
	* f : T -> T
	* p be in T
	* slope f p := 
		* <the following versions are equivalent>
		* limit p (\ x -> (f x - f p) / (x - p))
		* limit 0 (\ h -> (f (p + h) - f p) / h)
* slope does not necessarily exist
* some mathematicians insist that the domain of the function must be topologically open; i do not see why
* naming
	* most usual name of slope is "derivative"
		* this is a stupid name choice, as many things can be derived from a function [integral, dispersion, ...]
	* the best name, IMO, would probably be "speed"
* existence of slope => continuity
	* proof is easy
* slope (const k) = 0
* slope (* k) = k
* slope of inverse

	* proof by induction
		* k = 1 => slope (pow k) = const 1   <- okay
		* k = 2 => slope (pow k) = (2 *)     <- okay
		* k = n => slope (pow k) = 
			* slope (id * pow (n - 1)) =
			* slope id * pow (n - 1) + id * slope (pow (n - 1)) =
			* pow (n - 1) + id * ((n - 1) * pow (n - 2)) =
			* pow (n - 1) + (n - 1) * pow (n - 1) = n * pow (n - 1)
			* <- okay
* speed of speed
	* "n-th speed" := the speed of the speed of the ... - for n times
* "slopy" or "speedy" := has speed
* "continuously speedy" := has speed, which is continous
	* 'n times contiuously speedy' - "Cn"
		* n is said to be the "smoothness" of the function
		* without extra relevant context: "smooth" = infinitely speedy
* anti-slope ["anti-derivative"]
