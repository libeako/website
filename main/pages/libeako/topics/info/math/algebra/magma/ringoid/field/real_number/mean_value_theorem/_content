* f, g : Real -> Real, continuous
* a, b : Real, a < b
* Rolle's theorem
	* proposition
		* f a = f b => exists x. (a <= x <= b) and (speed f x = 0)
	* proof
		* if f is constant on [a .. b] 
			* then the (speed f) is constantly 0
			* else
				* interval [a - b] is compact; hence f takes its maximum and minimum on it
				* let m be the minimum or maximum of f on [a - b], so that (f m) does not equal to (f a) or (f b)
				* speed f m = 0
					* this is easy to prove
* mean value theorem
	* proposition
		* with 
			* c = (f a - f b) / (a - b)
			* exists x in [a - b]. speed f x = c
	* proof
		* g x := f x - c * (x - a)
		* apply Rolle's theorem on g to get that
		* exists x in [a - b]. speed g x = 0
		* hence (speed f x = c)
* generalized mean value theorem
	* also known as "Cauchy mean value theorem"
	* proposition
		* exists x in [a .. b]. (speed f x) (g a - g b) = (speed g x) * (f a - f b)
	* proof
		* h x := (f x) (g a - g b) - (g x) * (f a - f b)
		* h a = - (f a) * (g b) + (g a) * (f b)
		* h b = (f b) * (g a) - (g b) * (f a) 
		* hence (h a = h b), hence Rolle's theorem is applicable
		* by Rolle's theorem: (exists x in [a - b]. speed h x = 0), from which the proposition of the theorem shortly follows
	* if (speed g) does not equal 0 anywhere on [a .. b] then (g a =/= g b) and hence
		* exists x in [a .. b]. (speed f x) / (speed g x) = (f a - f b) / (g a - g b)
