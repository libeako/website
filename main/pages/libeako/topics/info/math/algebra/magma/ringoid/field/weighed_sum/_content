* weights are scalar values; we multiply with them some things and sum the results; this is a dot-product operation
* dp := dotproduct
* the weights form a vector
* when the weights are >= 0 and <s and (their sum = s) then they are an "s-distribution"
	* this term is invented by me
	* the default value of s = 1
	* the default "distribution" is a 1-distribution
* reciprocal distribution is a vector of scalars whose reciprocs form a [1-]distribution
