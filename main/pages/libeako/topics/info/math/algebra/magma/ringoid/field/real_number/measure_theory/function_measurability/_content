* definition of function measurability
	* let G be any of the above set of sets
	* a function (f : i -> Extended Real) is "measurable" iff
		* forall g in G. (lift (inverse f) g) is measurable
	* this definition is equivalent across all possible G choices because
		* and
			* the (function inverse image) commutes with the methods of sigma algebra [complementer, interection or union]
			* these G choices generate the Borel sigma algebga and hence they generate each other
* all continuous functions are measurable
