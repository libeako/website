* these following sets of sets all generate the Borel sigma algebra

* definition of function measurability
	* let G be any of the above set of sets
	* a function (f : i -> Extended Real) is "measurable" iff
		* forall g in G. (lift (inverse f) g) is measurable
	* this definition is equivalent across all possible G choices because
		* and
			* the (function inverse image) commutes with the methods of sigma algebra [complementer, interection or union]
			* these G choices generate the Borel sigma algebga and hence they generate each other
* all continuous functions are measurable

* if f is measurable and g is continuous then (f >>> g) is measurable
	* proof is trivial

* definition of the 'indicator' function
	* indic : Set t -> t -> Real := s x -> if (x is element of s) then 1 else 0
* definition of 'step function', 'simple function'
	* X, Y : Type
		* Y is a field
	* P : Set (Set X)
		* finite
	* k : P -> Y
	* f : X -> Y = sum (lift2 (*) k indic)
	* if P consists of invtervals      then f is a step   function
	* if P consists of measurable sets then f is a simple function
	* f is said to be in 'canonical' [or 'standard'] form iff (P is disjunct and all outputs of k are different)
		* the canonical form is unique
			* proof is easy
