		* monotone leniently increasing non-negative functions
	* constant function
		* proposition
			* if
				* p is in M
				* l : Real
				* constrain-to p (limit g) >= constant l
			* then
				* limit (g >>> integral) >= l * m p
		* proof
			* take arbitrary k < l
			* q := g >>> (>>> (>= k)) >>> from-predicate-to-set >>> intersect p
				* q is monotone leniently increasing
				* the limit of q-s is p, as g reaches k at every point of p at some place in the sequence
			* hance (m (limit q) = limit (q >>> m))
				* implied by
					* the monotonicity of q, as precondition of
					* the continuity of measure
						* \ links-to internal ifslvryguaturinf
			* hence forall (e : Real+). exists n : Nat+ -> m (q n) > m p - e
			* hence (integral (g n) >= m (q n) * k >= (m p - e) * k)
			* (e is arbitrarily close to 0) and (k is arbitrarily close to l)
			* hence (limit (g >>> integral)) >= m p * l
	* simple function
		* similarly to the previous theorem, but make the limit a simple function on the whole space instead of a constant on a measurable subset
		* proof is trivial, just traverse the base sets of the limiting function [where it is a constant] and for each of them use the previous theorem

				* limit (g >>> integral) = integral f
		* proof
			* <= is trivial
			* >= is easy
				* take arbitrary simple funcrion h, such that (h <= f)
				* we only need to prove that

		* proposition
			* exists g : Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real+
				* all non-negative measurable
				* monotone leniently increasing
				* g point-wise converges to f
				* forall n : Nat+
					* with
						* h := flip power 2
						* forall x : S. (norm (f x - g n x) <= 1 / n) or (g n x > h n)
		* proof
			* plan
				* construct partitions of the codomain with ever increasing resolution
				* consider the inverse images of the partition members; they are measurable, because f is measurable
				* construct the searched function so that it is a simple function with this base partitioning of its domain; for each partition. map the lower end of the corresponding codomain interval
				* for each codomain interval
					* the size of the interval is a limit of the difference between the f and the constructed approximator function; but that size is decreasing tas the resolution of the partitioning increases
			* we devide the codomain to 2 parts, becasue the infinity case needs to be handled differently
				* [0 .. h n)
				* [h n .. +infinity]
			* we further divide the first partition to sub-partitions each with length (1 / h n)
				* hence the number of such sub-partition is (power 2 (h n))
			* as n converges to infinity
				* h converges to infinity [the first part covers every finite value eventually]
				* the resolution of the first part grows
			* D k := lift (inverse f) (k-th subpartition of the codomain)
				* is measurable, because f is measurable
			* DD := lift (inverse f) [h n .. +infinity]
				* is measurable, because f is measurable
			* g x :=
				* +
					* sum (lift (k -> (k / h n) * indicator-function-of (D k)) [0 .. h n))
					* h n * indicator-function-of DD

			* exists monotone leniently increasing sequence of simple on-negative functions g, point-wise converging to f, such that
				* limit (g >>> integral) = integral f
		* proof
			* existence

		* with this theorem in hand it is easy to prove (commutation between function addition and integration)
	* monotone convergence theorem
		\ id odaoigvrimtqesfn
		* proposition
			* if
				* g : Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real
				* all g are non-negative measurable
				* g is monotone leniently increasing
				* exists f. g converges to f point-wise
			* then
				* f is measurable
				* integral f = limit (g >>> integral)
		* proof
			* the measurability of f comes from
				* point-wise limit of measurable functions is measurable
					\ links-to internal ubpcmljjbniytygd
			* measurability gives Lebesgue integrability
			* by 
				* theoream about exists converging function sequence
					\ links-to internal vgndtkinbxijcvdf
			* exists h : Nat+ -> Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real
				* forall i
					* (h i) is a sequence of non-negative simple functions
					* (h i) converges to (g i)
					* forall n : Nat+. forall x : S. ((g i x - h i n x) <= 1 / power n 2) or (h i n x >= power n 2)
			* j n := h n n
			* j is a sequence of non-negative simple functions
			* forall n. j n <= f
				* implied by the transitivity of (<=)
			* j point-wise converges to f
				* proof
					* take arbitrary (x : S)
					* if (for infinitely many n. j n x = h n n x >= power n 2)
						* then (flip j x) converges to +infinity, hence it converges to (f x)
						* otherwise 
							* for some k. forall n > k. (g n x - j n x) <= 1 / power n 2
							* which implies (flip j x) converges to (g n x), which converges to (f x)
			* l n := the point-wise max of {j i | 0 < i <= n}
			* l inherits all the properties of j already proven and gains that monotone leniently increases
			* thus l has all the conditions that are required by
				* theorem (converging functions converge in their integral too)
					\ links-to internal birkhvgnkzkzupbd
			* hence (integral f = limit (l >>> integral))
			* (forall n. l n <= g n); hence
			* limit (l >>> integral) <= limit (g >>> integral)
			* by transitivity of (<=):
			* integral f <= limit (g >>> integral)
			* the other direction inequality is trivial, as forall n. g n <= f
		* the condition (g is increasing) of the theorem is necessary
			* example
				* m := the standard counting measure on the naturals
				* g n x := 
					* if x = n
						* then 1
						* else 0
				* g converges to (constant 0), but all g have integral value 1
