* weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality
	* proposition
		* if
			* 1-distribution w
			* non-negative reals x
		* then
			* product (lift2 power w x) <= dot-product w x
	* proof
		* exp (dot-product w y) <= dot-product w (lift exp y)
		* y := lift ln x
		* transforming both sides
			* exp (dot-product w y) =
				* exp (dot-product w (lift ln x)) =
				* product (lift exp (w * lift ln x)) =
				* product (lift2 power w x)
			* dot-product w (lift exp y) =
				* dot-product w (lift exp (lift ln x)) = 
				* dot-product w (lift (exp <<< ln) x) = 
				* dot-product w x
		* hence
			* product (lift2 power w x) <= dot-product w x
	* corollary: geometric-arithmetic mean inequality
		* n := the number of components
		* all weights = 1 / n
		* power (1 / n) (product x) <= sum x / n
* Young's inequality is the same as the weighed geometric-arithmetic mean inequality, but the exponent flipped by its reciproc and the power flipped by the variable
	* proposition
		* if
			* reciprocal 1-distribution w
			* non-negative reals x
	* then
		* product x <= sum (lift2 power w x / w)
	* proof
		* can be derived from (the weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality), by doing the 2 flippings
		* analogously to the proof of (the weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality), but starting from (the concavity of ln) instead of (the convexity of exp)
