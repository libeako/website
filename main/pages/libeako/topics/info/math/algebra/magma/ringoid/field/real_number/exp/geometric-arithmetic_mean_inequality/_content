* weighed geometric-arithemetic mean inequality
	* proposition
		* if
			* 1-distribution w
			* non-negative reals x
		* then
			* product (lift2 (power w) x) <= dot-product w x
			* equality iff x is constant
	* proof
		* from
			* the Jensen inequality
				\ links-to internal luvukbhzqwcogeqe
			* we get
				* exp (dot-product w y) <= dot-product w (lift exp y)		
				* equality iff (y is constant)
		* y := lift ln x
		* transforming both sides
			* 
				* exp (dot-product w y) =
				* exp (dot-product w (lift ln x)) =
				* exp (sum (lift2 (*) w (lift ln x))) =
				* product (lift exp (lift2 (*) w (lift ln x))) =
				* product (n -> exp (w n *  (ln (x n)))) =
				* product (n -> power (w n) (x n)) =
				* product (lift2 power w x)
			* 
				* dot-product w (lift exp y) =
				* dot-product w (lift exp (lift ln x)) = 
				* dot-product w (lift (exp <<< ln) x) = 
				* dot-product w x
		* hence
			* product (lift2 power w x) <= dot-product w x
	* corollary: geometric-arithmetic mean inequality
		* n := the number of components
		* all weights = 1 / n
		* power (1 / n) (product x) <= sum x / n
* Young inequality
