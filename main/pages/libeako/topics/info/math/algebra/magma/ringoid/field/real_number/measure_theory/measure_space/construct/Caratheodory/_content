* given
	* (A : Set) - an algebra os sets
	* (v : A -> Extended Positive Real) - a finitely additive volume function on A
	* m -  the outer measure build on (A, v)
* the Caratheodory method constructs a real measure from an outerish measure
* in this part "m" is usual symbol of an outerish measure
* restrict its domain by
	* the Carathéodory measurability

* let "S" be the symbol for the resultant domain in this part; thus M is a set of measurable subsets of T
* the restriction of the outerish measure onto the set of Caratheodory-measurable sets is a real measure
	* it is additive
