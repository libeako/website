* proposition
	* if
		* f : Nat+ -> S -> Extended Real
			* all non-negative, measurable
	* then
		* integral (lift liminf (flip f)) <= liminf (f >>> integral)
* proof
	* g n := lift liminf (flip ((+ (n - 1)) >>> f))
	* g is monotone leniently increasing
	* g <= f
	* hence by
		* pointwise-limit of g exists
		* the monotone convergence theorem
			* \ links-to internal odaoigvrimtqesfn
		* integral (lift limit (flip g)) = limit (g >>> integral)
	* integral (lift liminf (flip f))
	* =
		* liminf of sequence = supremum of infimums of tails of sequence
	* integral (lift supremum (flip g))
	* =
		* g is monotone increasing
	* integral (lift limit (flip g))
	* =
		* by the monotone convergence theorem
	* limit (g >>> integral)
	* <=
		* g <= f
	* limiinf (f >>> integral)
		* the limit may not exist
