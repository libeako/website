	* proof
		* this proof is elaborated only for meet, but dually for join
		* mic x := meet x (complement x)
		* we only need to prove
			* foreach p q . mic p = mic q
		* let s be an element of S
			* S is not empty, by the secondary representation
		* n x := (join (mic x) = id)
		* forall x . n x, by the "secondary representation"
		* by (n q): mic p = join (mic q) (mic p)
		* by (n p): mic q = join (mic p) (mic q)
		* by commutativity of join: (mic p = mic q)
