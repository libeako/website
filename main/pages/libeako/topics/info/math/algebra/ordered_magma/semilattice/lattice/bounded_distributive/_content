* complement in bounded distributive lattice is unique
	* proof
		* suppose c1 and c2 are complements of x
		* then
			* join c1 x = top
			* join c2 x = top
			* meet c1 x = bottom
			* meet c2 x = bottom
		* c1 = join (meet c2 c1) (meet x c1)
			* proof
				* c1
				* =
					* by
						* absorption
							\ links-to internal oeltcgippeesnvsd
				* meet (join c1 x) c1 
				* =
					* because
						* join c1 x = top = join c2 x
				* meet (join c2 x) c1
				* =
					* by distributivity
				* join (meet c2 c1) (meet x c1)
		* c2 = join (meet c1 c2) (meet x c2)
			* dually
		* statment
			* =
				* join (meet c2 c1) (meet x c1)
				* join (meet c1 c2) (meet x c2)
			* proof
				* meet x c1 = bottom = meet x c2
				* meet c2 c1 = meet c1 c2
					* because commutativity of meet
		* hence c1 = c2
