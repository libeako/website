* an "ordered" magma is a magma with an ordering such that the operation is "monotone" in it
* "monotonity" of operation o with relation r means by definition that
	* forall x y s
		* r x y =>
			* and
				* r (o x s) (o y s)
				* r (o s x) (o s y)
* an other name of this property is that the operation and the order are "compatible"
* more sophisticated algebras [subtypes of magma] also have ordered versions, like ordered monoid
	* semilattice
