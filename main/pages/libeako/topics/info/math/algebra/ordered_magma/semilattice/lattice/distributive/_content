* representation
	* let (S, se) be a lattice
	* the distributivity equalities: for all x y z:
		* "m1j" - meet (join x y) z = join (meet x z) (meet y z)
		* "m2j" - meet x (join y z) = join (meet x y) (meet x z)
		* "j1m" - join (meet x y) z = meet (join x z) (join y z)
		* "j2m" - join x (meet y z) = meet (join x y) (join x z)
	* let either of these of the distributivity equations be true:
		* either
		* all
* equivalence of the representations
	* all => either : trivial
	* either => all
		* the equivalence between p1q and p2q is trivial, just use commutativity of the extremums and some shuffle of the x y z
		* m1j => j1m
			* meet (join x z) (join y z)

			* join (meet x y) z
		* j1m => m1j
			* dual of 'm1j => j1m'
* duality
	* statement: a lattice is dual iff its dual is distributive
	* proof: trivial, because the distributivity equations are dual of each other
