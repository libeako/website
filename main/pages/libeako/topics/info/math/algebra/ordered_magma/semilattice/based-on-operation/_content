* the definition: a semigroup that is also commutative and idempotent
* is determined by its selecting core
	\ id jnkggvgzfpsajuid
	* let "selective" mean that for function "<>" on values "x" and "y": 
		* or
			* x <> y = x
			* x <> y = y
	* let the "core" here mean tha subset of the domain of the function for which the function is selective
	* statement: this core determines the function outside of the core too
	* proof:
		* lemma "bound":
			* x <> y = b => 
				* and
					* x <> b = b
					* y <> b = b
			* proof:
				* it is enough to prove one of the consequences, because <> is commutative
				* x <> b = x <> (x <> y) = (x <> x) <> y = x <> y = b
