* representations based on
	* order
		* "lattice" is an order with all binary extremums existing
		* with other wording: it is both a join and meet semilattice, both corresponding to the same order
	* operation
		* "lattice" is a join and a meet semilattice operation so that they absorb each other
			* join x (meet x y) = x
			* meet x (join x y) = x
* equivalence of the 2 possible representations
	* order => operation
		* this direction is just an application of
			* extremum absorbs dual

	* operation => order
		* in order to construct an order-based representation of lattice: we need to specify an order 'se' to which both operations correspond according to the 
			* isomorphism between semilattice representations
				\ links-to internal yfrehcdkxqrbrkoy
			* let se correspond to the join operation by its definition
				* forall x y. (se x y <=> join x y = y)
			* se corresponds to the meet operation iff
				* forall x y. (meet x y = x <=> se x y)
			* thus we need:
				* forall x y. (meet x y = x <=> join x y = y)
			* which is a trivial consequence of the absorptions assumption
