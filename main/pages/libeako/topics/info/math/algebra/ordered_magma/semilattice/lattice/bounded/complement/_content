* in a bounded lattice:
	* c is a "complement" of x iff
		* join c x = top
		* meet c x = bottom
* the word "complement" comes from the word "complete", the complement of x is what is needed to make x complete; do not confuse with "compliment", which is saying something nice about something
* a lattice is "complemented" when all elements have complement
	* a lattice is uniquely "complemented" when all elements have unique complement
		* complement >>> complement = identity
			* proof
				* c being complement of x means:
					* join c x = top
					* meet c x = bottom
				* join and meet are commutative, hence:
					* join x c = top
					* meet x c = bottom
				* thus x is a complement of c, which is a complement of x, thus x is a complement of a complement of itself
				* uniqueness is by supposition
