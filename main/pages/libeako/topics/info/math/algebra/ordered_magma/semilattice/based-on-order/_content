* to understand you will need:
	* extremums
		\ links-to internal ixzcmqqgliligeti
	* partial order
		\ links-to internal xpcrgldjsphzyebu
* the definition:
	* let
		* S : Set
		* se : S -> S -> Bool, a partial order
		* j be the join function induced by se; let j be total
	* then (S, j) is a "join-semilattice"
	* thus: a "join-semilattice" is just a total join function
	* analogously for meet
