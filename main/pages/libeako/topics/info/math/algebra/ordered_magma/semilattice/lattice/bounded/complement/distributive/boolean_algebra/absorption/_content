* statement
	* primary representation of boolean algebra => absorption of meet and join
* proof
	* proof of (meet c >>> join c = id)
		* join c (meet c x)
		* =
			* by top being identity of meet
		* join (meet c top) (meet c x)
		* =
			* by distributivity of join over meet
		* meet c (join top x)
		* =
			* by 
				* top being absorber value of join

		* meet c top
		* =
			* by top bing identity of meet
		* c
	* proof of (join c >>> meet c = id): dually
