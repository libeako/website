* statement
	* complement in bounded distributive lattice is unique
* proof
	* suppose c1 and c2 are complements of x
	* then
		* join c1 x = top
		* join c2 x = top
		* meet c1 x = bottom
		* meet c2 x = bottom
	* c1 = join (meet c2 c1) bottom
		* proof
			* c1
			* =
				* by
					* absorption
						\ links-to internal oeltcgippeesnvsd
			* meet (join c1 x) c1 
			* =
				* because
					* join c1 x = top = join c2 x
			* meet (join c2 x) c1
			* =
				* by distributivity
			* join (meet c2 c1) (meet x c1)
			* =
				* by premiss
			* join (meet c2 c1) bottom
	* c2 = join (meet c1 c2) bottom
		* dually
	* => c1 = c2
