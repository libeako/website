* the definition: a semigroup that is also commutative and idempotent
* is determined by its selecting core
	\ id jnkggvgzfpsajuid
	* let "selective" mean that for function "<>" on values "x" and "y": 
		* or
			* x <> y = x
			* x <> y = y
	* let the "core" here mean tha subset of the domain of the function for which the function is selective
	* statement: this core determines the function outside of the core too
	* proof
		* i will use terminology from ordering, but keep in mind it is only terminology, i will not technically use any knowledge from ordering
		* the proof is a simple application of these lemmas
			* lemma "result is bound":
				* forall x y b
					* x <> y = b => 
						* and
							* x <> b = b
							* y <> b = b
				* proof:
					* it is enough to prove one of the consequences, because <> is commutative
					* x <> b = x <> (x <> y) = (x <> x) <> y = x <> y = b
			* lemma "result is minimal bound":
				* forall x y a b
					* =>
						* and
							* x <> y = a => 
							* and 
								* x <> b = b
								* y <> b = b
						* a <> b = b
				* proof:
					* a <> b = (x <> y) <> b = x <> (y <> b) = x <> b = b
			* lemma "the minimal bound is unique"
				* proof is a trivial proof by contradiction using the commutativity of <>
