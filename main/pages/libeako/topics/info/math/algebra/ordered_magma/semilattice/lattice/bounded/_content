* definitions
	* let S be a set
	* let se be an order on S
	* the differing parts of the definitions based on
		* extremum
			* let S contain all its finite extremums
			* then (S, se) is a "bounded lattice"
		* extremal
			* let S contain both of its extremals [minimal, maximal elements]
		* bound
			* let S be bounded
	* then (S, se) is a "bounded lattice"
* equivalence of the definitions
	* extremal <=> bound
		* proof is trivial
	* extremal => extremum
		* proof: inner bounds are extremums
	* extremum => extremal
		* proof:
			* "finite" contains the possibility of 0 too, the empty sets also have their extremums in S; the extremums of the empty set in S are the dual extremals of S
