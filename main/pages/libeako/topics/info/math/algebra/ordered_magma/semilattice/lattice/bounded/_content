* representation of "bounded lattice"
	* S : Set
	* se, an order on S
	* either
		* extremum
			* S contains all its finite extremums
		* extremal
			* (S, se) is a lattice
			* S contains both of its extremals [minimal, maximal elements]
				* this can also be expressed by 'S is bounded'
* equivalence of the represenations
	* extremum => extremal
		* proof:
			* "finite" contains the possibility of 0 too, the empty sets also have their extremums in S; the extremums of the empty set in S are the dual extremals of S
	* extremal => extremum
		* proof: 
			* being a lattice implies the existence of all the binary extremums, which implies the existence of the non-empty input extremums
			* the existence of both of the extremals implies the existence of the empty-input extremums
* complement
