* almost everywhere equal measurable functions squeeze function between them to be measurable in complete measure space
* proposition
	* if
		* (S, M, m) complete measure space
		* fl, fm, fh : M -> Extended Real
			* forall x : M. fl x <= fm x <= fh x
			* fl, fh are measurable
			* (fl = fh) almost everywhere
	* then
		* fm is measurable
* proof
	* take arbitrary (l : Extended Real)
	* dom f := lift (inverse f) [-infinity .. l)
	* we need to prove
		* dom fm is measurable
	* we know
		* dom fl is measurable
		* dom fh is measurable
	* from ((fl = fh) almost everywhere)
		* exists co, el, eh subsets of S
			* co is measurable
			* dom fl = union co el
			* dom fh = union co eh
			* m el = 0
			* m eh = 0
	* from (forall x : M. fl x <= fm x <= fh x)
		* dom fl <= dom fm <= dom fh
	* hence (exists em. el <= em <= eh. dom fm = union co em)
	* from (em <= eh): m em = 0
	* from (M is complete): m is measurable
