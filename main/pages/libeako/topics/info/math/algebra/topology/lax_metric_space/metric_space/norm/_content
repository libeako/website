* "prenorm"
	* is my term
	* representation
		* T : Type, monoid
		* n : T -> (Real & non-negative)
		* triangular inequality
			* forall x y in T. n (x + y) <= n x + n y
		* positive definiteness
			* forall x in T. x = 0 <=> n x > 0
* when T is rongoid
	* "subadditive norm"
		* norm with
			* forall x y in T. n (x * y) <= n x * n y
	* "additive norm"
		* norm with
			* forall x y in T. n (x * y)  = n x * n y
* norm
	* a better name for this concept would be "length"
	* representation
		* division ring (K, (+), (*)), with norm "ns"
		* vector space V
		* prenorm nv : V -> (Real & non-negative)
		* forall a in K, x in V . nv (a * x) = ns a * nv x
	* a norm on a vector space induces a metric
* notation
	* |_| and ||_|| are also used
