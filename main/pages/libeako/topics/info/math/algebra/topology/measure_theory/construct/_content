* elementary sets
	* generally
		* these are very simple sets of the space which you surely know the volume of
		* now you have a mapping from elementary sets to real numbers, i will say this is your "elementary measure"
		* include the empty set among the elementary sets and map 0 to it as its volume
* extend (the measure on the elementary subsets): construct
	* "outer" or "exterior" measure
