* continuity is a property of a function between 2 toplogies at a certain point
* let the name of the function be f and the name of the point be x, if not otherwise stated
* these definitions are equivalent
	* neighborhood inclusion
		* forall neighborhood of (f x) No: exist neighborhood of x Ni: lift f Ni <= No
		* this is the most intuitive definition and the general version of the definition often used in the scalar number fields
	* open neighborhood inclusion
		* forall open neighborhood of (f x) No: exist open neighborhood of x Ni: lift f Ni <= No
		* proof of equivalence is trivial
	* neighbohood's inverse image is neighborhood
		* forall neighbohood of (f x) No: (lift (inverse f) No) is neighbohood of x
		* proof of equivalence with definition 'neighborhood inclusion' is trivial
			* use these facts:
				* the inverse image of a smaller set is smaller
				* a set including a neighborhood is a neighborhood
* a function is continuous at a point iff at that point its value is its limit
	* proof is trivial
*  continuity is preserved by function composition
	* proof is trivial
* sequential continuity
	* definition
		* f is "sequentially continuous" at x iff
			* forall sequence x. x converges to x' => (x >>> f) converges to (f x')
	* if a function is continuous somewhere then it is sequentially continuous there
		* proof is trivial
	* sequential continuity is preserved by function composition
* continuous everywhere <=> inverse images of all open sets are open sets

	* proof
		* <=: trivial
		* =>:
			* take an arbitrary open set o in the codomain
			* go through all the points y of o
				* go through the points x of the inverse image of y
					* by continuity: an open neighborhood must exist containing x and being mapped into o
			* all these open neighborhoods map into o
			* the union of these open neighborhoods cover the inverse image of o
