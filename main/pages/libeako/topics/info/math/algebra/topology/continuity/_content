* the "continuity" concept is most generally defined in topology
* continuity is a property of a function between 2 toplogies at a certain point
* let the name of the function be f and the name of the point be x, if not otherwise stated
* these definitions are equivalent
	* neighborhood inclusion
		* forall neighbood No of (f x): exist neighborhood of x Ni: f Ni <= No
		* this is the most intuitive definition and the general version of the definition often used in the scalar number fields
	* open neighborhood inclusion
		* same as 'neighborhood inclusion' but uses (open neighborhood) instead of neighborhood
		* proof of equivalence is trivial
	* neighbohood's inverse image is neighborhood
		* forall neighbohood Ni of (f x): ((inverse f) Ni) is neighbohood of x
		* proof of equivalence with definition 'neighborhood inclusion' is trivial
			* use these facts:
				* the inverse image of a smaller set is smaller
				* a set including a neighborhood is a neighborhood
