* f is Lipschitz continuous when
	* exists Real k. forall x y. d (f x, f y) <= k * d (x, y)
* such f is said to be a "Lipschitz function"
* the smallest such k exists
	* because the inequality is not strict
	* it is named by "the Lipschitz constant", sometimes; sometimes any suitable k is considered to be a "Lipschitz constant"
* k <= 1
	* such function is said to be a "metric map", "nonexpansive map" or similar
	* such functions form a category
		* which is said to be the "category of metric spaces" ["Met"]
* k < 1
	\ id uuercwdupkozbdjr
	* such function is said to be a "contraction"
	* the number of fixed points of a contraction <= 1
