* proposition: 'compact' and 'sequentially compact' are equivalent
* proof
	* take arbitrary (S : Set)
	* sequentially compact => compact
		* let C be an open cover of S
		* using
			* the Lebesgue covering theorem
				\ links-to internal iwfingcdiypxxeav
		* let r be a Lebesgue radius of the covering
		* using that
			* sequentially compact set is totally bounded
				\ links-to internal luiynasvgjfttrnw
		* exists finite r-net that totally covers S
			* let its centers be (c 1), (c 2), ... (c k)
		* r is Lebesgue radius, hence
			* forall (n in [1 .. k]). some element of C includes (open-ball r (c n))
		* hence these finite number of elements of C are also a cover of S
	* compact => sequentially compact
		* take arbitrary x sequence in S; assume that it contains no subsequence converging to an element of S
		* if any member of it occurs in it for infinite number than they form a convergent subsequent that we seek; otherwise:
		* delete all the repetitions from the sequence, resulting in a subsequence of the original sequence; this new sequence will be proved to contain a subsequence that we seek; the name "x" will be continued to be used for this new, repetation-less sequence
		* as-set x
			* does not contain limit point
			* hence it contains all its limit points
			* hence it is closed
			* hence its complementer is open
		* forall (n : Nat+). exists (r > 0). (open-ball r (x n)) does not contain any other member of x
			* otherwise that (x n) would be a limit point of the sequence which is not possible by assumption
		* rather let "r" be such a sequence of radiuses
		* union ({complement (as-set x)}, {for (n : Nat+). open-ball (r n) (x n)}) is an open cover of the space
		* this open cover may not have a finite subcover, as then some of the members of x would not be covered; this is a contradiction
