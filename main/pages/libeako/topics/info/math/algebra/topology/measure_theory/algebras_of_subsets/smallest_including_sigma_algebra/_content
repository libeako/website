* proposition
	* informally
		* forall set x. a smallest (sigma algebra containing x) exists
	* more formally
		* if
			* T : Set
			* x : Set
			* x <= T
			* c (s : Set) := (x <= s <= T) and (s is a sigma algebra)
		* then
			* exists s. (c s) and (forall b : Set. c b => s <= b)
* proof
	* P := the power-set of T
	* c P
	* SS : Set := { for s in P. c p }
	* SS is not empty, as P is element of it
	* hence we can form the intersection of all its member-sets
	* s := intersect SS
	* remains to prove (c s)
		* just go through the definitions and whenever (you need to prove about a set that it is a member of s) then observe that it is a member of all the member-sets of SS
