* proposition
	* if
		* T : Set
		* f : T -> Extended Real
			* measurable
	* then the inverse images of all intervals and all open and closed sets are measurable
* proof
	* i := lift (inverse f)
	* the important tool in this proof is that set union, intersection, complementer commute with inverse image taking
		* i (union y1 y2) = union (i y1) (i y2)
			* for any number of union inputs
		* i (intersect y1 y2) = intersect (i y1) (i y2)
			* for any number of intersection inputs
		* i (complementer y) = complementer (i y)
	* for intervals
		* take arbitrary (l : Extended Real)
		* for half-finite half-infinite intervals
			* for high-limitted intervals
				* i [-infinity .. l) is measurable
					* by the measurability of f
				* i [-infinity .. l]
					* =
					* i (intersect (fun n -> [-infinity .. (l + 1 / n)]))
					* =
						* inverse image taking commutes with intersection
					* intersect (fun n -> i ([-infinity .. (l + 1 / n)]))
					* which is measurable, as intersection of countable measurable sets is measurable
			* for (i [l .. +infinity]) and (i ( l .. +infinity)
				* is deducable trivially
					* from the high-limitted case
					* by applying the commutation between inverse image taking and complementer taking
		* for finite intervals
			* is deducable trivially
				* from the infinite cases
				* by applying the commutation between inverse image taking and intersection
					* finite intervals are intersection of half-finite intervals
	* for open sets
		* is deducable trivially by
			* using 
				* in 1 dimensional line: all open sets are countable unions of open intervals

					* proof
						* all open sets are open intervals; each open interval is a union of some open intervals with rational limits; rationals are countable			
			* applying the commutation between inverse image taking and union
	* for closed sets
		* is deducable trivially by applying the commutation between inverse image taking and complementer taking
