* representations of completeness
	* [C]: Cauchy => convergent
	* [I]: forall (infinite nested sequence s of closed balls with radiuses converging to 0)
		* the intersection of the elements of s is not empty
* proof of equivalences
	* C => I
		* take an arbitrary sequence of balls as in I
		* take the sequence of the centers of the balls - it is Cauchy; hence by the assumption [C] it converges; let us name the limit by "p"
		* p i in all of the balls
			* proof is by contradiction
				* suppose at least one of the balls does not contain p; then all the later ones also do not contain p
				* the balls are closed, hence p is separated from those balls by at least a finite positive distance; hence p is disattached from the sequence it is supposed to be the limit of
	* I => C
		* take an arbitrary Cauchy sequence
		* take the real sequence (divide 1); forall of its elements: create the ball that contains some tail part of the ball sequence; delete the ones that are not fully in the previous one; take the intersection of the remaining balls
		* by assumption [I] the intersection is not empty
		* it must consist of only 1 point, otherwise they could not all be contained by the small balls
		* the taken Cauchy sequence converges to this single point; proof is easy
