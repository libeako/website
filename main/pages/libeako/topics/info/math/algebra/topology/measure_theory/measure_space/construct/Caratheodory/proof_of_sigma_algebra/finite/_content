* the main structure of the proof will be a branching on the number of sets whose union or intersection is the subject:
* 0
	* {} is measurable
		* proof is trivial in the definition of CarathÃ©odory measurability
	* hence full [as complementer of {}] is measurable too
* 1: trivial
* 2
	* take x, y arbitrary measurable sets, s arbitrary set
	* i aim to prove
		* m s = m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (complement (intersect x y)))
	* from the measurability of x
		* m s = m (intersect s x) + m (intersect s (complement x))
	* from the measurability of y
		* m (intersect s x) = m (intersect (intersect s x) y) + m (intersect (intersect s x) (complement y))
			* (intersect s x) is used as the test set in the Caratheodory measurability
	* starting from the first:
	* m s = m (intersect s x) + m (intersect s (complement x))
	* =
		* using the second
	* m (intersect (intersect s x) y) + m (intersect (intersect s x) (complement y)) + m (intersect s (complement x))
	* =
		* implied by the associativity of 'intersect'
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (intersect x (complement y))) + m (intersect s (complement x))
	* >=
		* implied by subadditivity of m
			* implied by (m is outerish)
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (union (intersect s (intersect x (complement y))) (intersect s (complement x)))
	* =
		* implied by DeMorgan set-equality
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (union (intersect x (complement y)) (complement x)))
	* =
		* implied by DeMorgan set-equality
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (intersect (union x (complement x)) (union (complement y) (complement x))))
	* =
		* union x (complement x) = full
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (intersect full (union (complement y) (complement x))))
	* =
		* intersect full = id
	* =
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (union (complement y) (complement x)))
	* =
		* union of complements is complement of intersection
	* m (intersect s (intersect x y)) + m (intersect s (complement (intersect x y)))
* (> 2) and finite
	* by natural induction on case '2'
