			\ links-to internal xwtushdgpcpdhxms
	* then
		* a set c is Carathéodory m-measurably iff
		* forall set s
			* m s = m (intersect s c) + m (intersect s (complement c))
				* this can be written also as
					* with
						* names
							* im := intersect s >>> m
						* im s = im c + im (complement c)
* if m is
	* outerish
		\ links-to internal xwtushdgpcpdhxms
	* then 
		* <= is implied by the subadditivity of m being an outer measure
		* hence to prove measurability: it is enough to prove >=
* i may use the short "measurable" instead of "Carathéodory measurable"
* intuition
