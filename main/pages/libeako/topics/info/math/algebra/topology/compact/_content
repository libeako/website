* a set S is "compact" iff all open covers of S have a finite sub-cover
	* an open "cover" of S is a set of open sets whose union contains S
	* a sub-cover is a subset of a cover which is also cover
* a subset H of a space is "convergently compact" or "sequentially compact" iff all infinite sequences of H contain subsequence which converges in H
	* the name "convergently compact" is my invention
	* i do not like the name "sequentially compact" because it does not involve the sequence notion more than 'countably compact'ness does
* continuous image of compact set is compact
	* proof
		* let f be a 
			* continuous function
				\ links-to internal ijidewelvrqswzry
		* let K be a compact subset of the domain of f
		* let UO be an open cover of the image of K
		* let UI be the set of inverse images of members of UO
			* the members of UI are open sets
				* as they are inverse continuous images of open sets

		* UI is an open cover of K
		* K is compact, hence UI has a finite subcover
* Cantor's intersection theorem: monotone decreasing sequence of non-empty sequentially compact sets have non-empty intersection
	* proof
		* choose a point from each set
		* this sequence is in a sequentially compact set, hence has a subsequence with a limit point
		* each set is sequentially compact, hence contains this limit point
* finite intersection property
	* a set of closed sets has "the finite intersection property" iff all finite subsets of the sets have a non-empty intersection
	* (a set of closed sets having the finite intersection property implying their intersection to be non-empty) is equaivalent to (open covers having finite subcover)
		* they are dual of each other; this duality is bridged by De Morgan set equalities
