* "extreme value theorem"
	* let
		* C be a metric space, compact
		* O be an totally ordered metric space
		* f : C -> O, continuous
	* f attains its extremums
	* proof
		* continuous image of comact set is comact; hence the image of f is bounded, hence it has its extremums
		* suppose that the extremum is not attained; that implies that it is possible to construct an infinite sequence that converges to the extremum
		* the inverse-f image of this sequence, being in a compact space, has a convergent subsequence
		* f is continuous, hence at the limit of this seubsequence it takes the limit of the images of the elements of the sequence, which is the extremum
