* theorem
	* proposition
		* f : X -> Y is continuous at x iff
			* forall open-ball yb with center (f x) and inside Y
				* exists open-ball xb around center x and inside X
					* yb containes {f p | p in xb}
	* proof is trivial
* theorem
	* proposition
		* if X, Y are metric spaces and f : X -> Y and (x : X)
			* equivalent
				* f is continuous at x
				* f is sequentially continuous at x
	* proof
		* => - this is proven generally in topology
		* <= - easy to prove the contrapositive
			* being in metric space allows us to have a sequence that converges to zero size; for example (divide 1)
			* consider the sequence of open-balls with center x and these decreasing radiuses
			* the contrapositive assumption is that f is not continuous at x, which is (exist neighborhood K of (f x) such that all neighborhood of x contain a point whose image is outside of K)
			* for neighborhoods of x consider the earlier mentioned balls with radiuses decreaing to zero; let "p" mean the points with outside of K image; then p converges to x, yet (p >>> f) does not converge to (f x); hence f is not sequentially continuous, which is the wanted contrapositive conclusion
* uniform continuity
	* f is "uniformly continuous" when
		* forall dy > 0. exists dx > 0. forall x1 x2. d (x1, x2) < dx => d (f x1, f x2) < dy
	* uniform continuity implies continuity
		* proof is trivial
