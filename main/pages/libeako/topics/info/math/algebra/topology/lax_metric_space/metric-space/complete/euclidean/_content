* the euclidean is a space, all dimensions of which is of type real numbers
* theorem: the real numbers space is complete
	* proof
		* take an arbitrary Cauchy point sequence
		* take the decreasing real sequence (devide 1)
		* forall element d of this real sequence
			* some tail part of the point sequence is bound in a (2 * d) interval
		* the 2 ends of this interval sequences form 2 point sequences
		* both of the end-sequences must converge to the same number, otherwise
