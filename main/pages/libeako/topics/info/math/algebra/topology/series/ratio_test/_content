* proposition
	* if
		* s is a sequence
		* r n := norm (s (n + 1) / s n)
	* then
		* if (limsup r) < 1 then s converges absolutely
		* if (liminf r) > 1 then s diverges
* proof
	* if (liminf r > 1)
		* the components of the series grow at almost each step, hence the series diverges
	* if (limsup r < 1)
		* (s >>> norm) decreases faster than geometric series, hence s is absolutely convergent
* other names may be "Cauchy ratio test", "D'Alambert's test"
