* proposition
	* if
		* s is a sequence
		* limit of (fun n -> norm (s (n + 1) / s n)) exists; lets name it by "l"
	* then
		* l > 1 => (series s) is divergent
		* l < 1 => (series s) is convergent
* proof
	* l > 1 the components of the series grow, hence the series diverges
	* l < 1
		* the norms of Cauchy segments of the series are smaller then the Cauchy segments of the norms of the components [triangular inequality of the norm], which are smaller than of the geometric series, which converges
* other names may be "Cauchy ratio test", "D'Alambert's test"
