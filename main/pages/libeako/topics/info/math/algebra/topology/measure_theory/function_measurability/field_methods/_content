* if
	* f, g : S -> Extended Real
		* measurable
* then
	* forall (c : Real). (c * f) is measurable
	* negate f is measurable
		* proof is trivial
			* even by just using
				* equivalence of definitions of function measurability

	* reciproc
		* proof is easy, as of negation, but somewhat complicated with branching over negativity
	* (f + g) is measurable
		* proof
			* take arbitrary (l : Real)
			* X := keep ((fl, gl) -> ((fl + gl) < l)) (cross-power 2 Real)
			* we need to prove (keep (x -> (f x + g x) < l) Real) is measurable
			* keep (x -> (f x + g x) < l) Real
			* =
				* change to countable rational limits
			* union (lift (lr -> keep (fun x -> (f x + g x) < lr) Real) (keep (< l) rational))
			* countable union of measurable sets is measurable; hence we need to prove only
				* for arbitrary lr
					* (keep (x -> (f x + g x) < lr) Real) is measurable
			* ((f x + g x) < lr) = or (exists fr gr : Rational. (fr + gr < lr) and (f x < fr and g x < gr))
			* countable intersection of measurable sets is measurable; hence we need to prove only the measurability of
				* keep (f >>> (< fr)) Real
				* keep (g >>> (< gr)) Real
			* which is given by the measurability of f and g
	* (f * g) is measurable
		* proof
			* f * g = (power 2 (f + g) - (power 2 f + power 2 g)) / 2
