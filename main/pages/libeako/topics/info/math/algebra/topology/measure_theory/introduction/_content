* goal is to determine volumes of space, area, length, ...
* the name "quantity" or "quantization" would perhaps be better
* motivation: it is not easy
	* example: [0, 1] and [0, 2] have different sizes intuitively, but the same number of points
* consistency
	* is a requirement for any theory
	* in measure theory it requires
		* preferrably additivity, but at least sub-additivity
			* these requirements are for the countably many summations
				* finite additivity is too weak, because in real number analysis countable sequences are too important to miss
				* continuum additivity is
					* too strong
						* because for instance it would allow any (intuitively non-zero sized) sets [for example spheres] to have zero measure only because all its continuum number of points individually have zero measure
					* not needed
						* this is implied by
							* of any set of non-negative real numbers with finite sum: only countably many members can be positive
								* the proof is easy: forall n : Nat+. only finitely many can be above (1 / n)
		* additivity for all subsets is not always possible
			* 2 solutions are known
				* use sub-additivity, via outer measure
				* restrict the measure function to a subset of "measurable" subsets
