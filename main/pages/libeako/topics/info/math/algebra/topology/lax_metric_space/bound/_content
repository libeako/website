* a subset of a lax metric space is "bounded" iff exists real number K. forall points x y of the subset. d (x, y) <= K
* the space is bounded iff its entirety as a subset is bounded
* when the subset is non-empty then
	* this is equivalent to
		* exists (c : Point)  (K : Real). forall (p : Point). d (p, c) <= K
		* the proof is trivial
* a space is "totally bounded" iff for all e > 0. it is covered by a finite e-net
	* totally bounded => bounded
		* proof is trivial
	* the opposite direction is not generally true
		* counter-examples
			* the discrete metric [maps 0 to equal, 1 to unequal point-pairs] on any infinite set
			* (Real, \ (x, y) -> min {1, norm (x - y)})
