* proposition
	* if
		* R is a semi-algebra
		* A := union {R, {empty, full}, {all finite disjoint unions of elements of R}}
	* then
		* A is an algebra generated by R
* proof
	* any algebra including R must include A too
	* A is an algebra
		* is closed under finite intersection
			* under nullary intersection
				* this is the full base-set, which is element of A by assumption
			* under binary intersection
				* take arbitrary (S : [0 .. 1] -> A)
				* if (S 1) or (S 2) is empty or full then trivial
				* else
					* exist (m : Nat+) (P : (i : [1 .. 2]) -> m i -> R)
						* forall (i : [1 .. 2])
							* members of (P i) are disjoint
							* union (P i) = S i
					* intersect (S 1, S 2)
					* = 
						* by DeMorgan set equality
					* union ((k1 : [1 .. m 1]), (k2 : [1 .. m 2]) -> intersect (P 1 k1) (P 2 k2))
					* all the arguments of this union are in R and are disjoint, hence the union of them is also in R
		* is closed under complementer
			* take arbitrary (S : A)
			* if S is empty of full then trivial
			* else
				* exists (m : Nat+) (P : [1 .. m] -> R)
					* union P = S
					* members of P are disjoint
					* no member of P is full
						* otherwise S would be full too
					* no member of P is empty
						* otherwise we can delete it from P without changing (union P)
						* this deletion can not result in an ampty P, because then S would be empty too
				* complementer S = complementer (union P)
				* =
					* by DeMorgan set equality
				* intersection (lift complementer P)
				* the complementer of each member of P is (a union of disjoint non-empty members of R), hence is in A and the previous part of this proof proved that A is closed under finite intersection
