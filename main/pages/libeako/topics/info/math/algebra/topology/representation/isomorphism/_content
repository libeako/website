* this page proves that the following 2 representations of topology are isomorphic
	* subset

* proof
	* the interior making function
		* make-in (S : Set) (ss : Set (S -> Bool)) (s : S) = union { b in ss : se b s }
			* proof that output of make-in fullfills the axioms of the Kuratowski representation is trivial
	* subsets making function
		* make-subsets (S : Set) (in : endo (S -> Bool)) = { s in S : in s = s }
			* proof that output of make-in fullfills the axioms of the subsets representation
				* ss := make-subsets in
				* let I be a set of indexes such that forall i in I : xi is in ss [equivalently: in xi = xi]
				* closedness under union
					* the goal is to prove 
						* (in (union { for i in I : x i })) is in ss too
						* using the definition of ss: 
						* in (union { for i in I : x i : }) = union { for i in I : x i }
					* <=
						* the proof of this direction is trivial because of the Kuratowski axiom
							* forall s : se (in s) s
					* >=
						* to prove this direction it is enough to prove
							* forall j in I
								* in (union { for i in I : x i }) >= x j
						* the proof of which is simply
							* in (union { for i in I : x i}) >= in (x j) = x j
				* closedness under intersection
					* the proof is simple application of the corresponding Kuratowski axiom
					* assume forall i in I : xi is in ss [equivalently: in xi = xi]
					* then
					* intersect {for i in I : xi}
					* =
					* intersect {for i in I : in xi}
					* =
					* in (intersect {for i in I : xi})
					* which is in ss
	* proof that make-subsets and make-in are inverses of each other
		* make-in >>> make-subset = id
			* make-subset (make-in ss) = ss
			* make-subset (\ s -> union { o in ss : o <= s }) = ss
			* { t : (\ s -> union { o in ss : o <= s }) t = t } = ss
			* { t : (union { o in ss : o <= t }) = t } = ss

		* make-subset >>> make-in = id
			* (make-subset >>> make-in) in = id in
			* make-in (make-subset in) = in
			* make-in (make-subset in) s = in s
			* make-in { b : b = in b } s = in s
			* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } = in s
			* the proof will be the conjunction of the proofs of the ineualities
				* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } <= in s
					* proof
						* for each b in the union in the left side
							* in b <= s
							* hence
								* in is monotone
									* \ links-to internal hkvjhutkeqeslbqw
							* in (in b) <= in s
							* hence
								* idempotence of in
							* in b <= in s
							* hence
								* because b = in b
							* b <= in s
						* hence also for the union of such bs
				* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } >= in s
					* b = (in s) is among the arguments of the union
						* because of (idempotence of in) and (in s <= s), which both are Kuratowski axioms
