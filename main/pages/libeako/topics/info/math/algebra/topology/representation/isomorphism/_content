* induces subset representation
	* the interior making function
		* make-in (S : Set) (ss : Set (S -> Bool)) (s : S) = union { b in ss : b <= s }
			* proof that output of make-in fullfills the axioms of the Kuratowski representation is trivial
		* make-subsets (S : Set) (in : endo function on (S -> Bool)) = { s in S : in s = s }
			* proof that output of make-in fullfills the axioms of the subsets representation
				* closedness under union
					* let I be a set of indexes
					* ss := make-subsets in
						* the set of open sets of the topology
					* suppose forall i in I : (in (x i)) is in ss
						* using the definition of ss: in (x i) = x i
					* then (in (union { x i : i in I })) is in ss too
						* using the definition of ss: 
							* in (union { x i : i in I }) = union { x i : i in I }
						* <=
							* the proof of this direction is trivial because of the Kuratowski axiom
								* forall s : in s <= s
						* >=
							* to prove this direction it is enough to prove
								* forall j in I
									* in (union { x i : i in I }) >= x j
							* the proof of which is simply
								* in (union { x i : i in I }) >= in (x j) = x j
				* closedness under intersection
					* the proof is simple application of the corresponding Kuratowski axiom
		* proof that make-subsets and make-in are inverses of each other
			* make-in >>> make-subset = id
				* make-subset (make-in ss) = ss
				* make-subset (\ s -> union { o in ss : o <= s }) = ss
				* { t : (\ s -> union { o in ss : o <= s }) t = t } = ss
				* { t : (union { o in ss : o <= t }) = t } = ss

			* make-subset >>> make-in = id
				* (make-subset >>> make-in) in = id in
				* make-in (make-subset in) = in
				* make-in (make-subset in) s = in s
				* make-in { b : b = in b } s = in s
				* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } = in s
				* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } <= in s
					* proof is trivial, because
						* forall b : b <= s
				* union { b : (b = in b) and b <= s } >= in s
					* (in s) is among the arguments of the union
						* because of (idempotence of in) and (in s <= s), which both are Kuratowski axioms
