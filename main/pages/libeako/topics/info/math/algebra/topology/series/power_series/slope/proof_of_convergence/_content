* the conclusion of this theorem consists of 2 parts: slope, anti-slope; the anti-slope part is a trivial consequence of the slope part
* if (norm z > r)
	* (s n * power n z) is divergent
	* hence
	* s n * n * power (n - 1) z =
	* s n * power n z * (n / z)
	* is also absolutely divergent
* if (norm z < r)
	* let q be a real such that (norm z) < q < r
	* then
	* q is pozitive
	* norm (s n * n * power (n - 1) z) =
	* norm (s n * n * power (n - 1) ((z * q / q)) =
	* norm (s n * n * power (n - 1) (z / q) * power (n - 1) q =
	* norm (n * power (n - 1) (z / q) * s n * power (n - 1) q =
	* norm (n * power (n - 1) (z / q)) * norm (s n * power (n - 1) q)
	* <=
		* norm (n * power (n - 1) (z / q)) is bounded
			* because the series (n * power (n - 1) (z / q)) is convergent
				* because
					* the radius of convergence of (x -> series (n * power (n - 1) x) is 1
						* this is easy to see from the ratio test
					* z / q < 1
		* let m be the name of an upper bound
	* m * norm (s n * power (n - 1) q) =
	* (m / q) * norm (s n * power n q)
	* series (s n * power n q) is absolutely convergent
		* because of
			* (s n * power n q) is the original series component
			* q < r
