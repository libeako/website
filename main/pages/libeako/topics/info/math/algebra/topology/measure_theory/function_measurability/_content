* a function (f : i -> Extended Real) is "measurable" iff
	* forall l : Real. (keep (f >>> (< l)) i) is measurable
* equivalence of measurability definitions - measureability of inverse images of basic subsets

* this proof technique works from any of the other kind of half-infinite half-finite intervals; hence any of those kinds too could be used to define 'measurability of function'
* all continuous functions are measurable

* if f is measurable and g is continuous then (f >>> g) is measurable
	* proof is trivial
* field methods on measurability
