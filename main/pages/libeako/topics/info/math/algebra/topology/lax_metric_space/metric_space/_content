* "metric" space is lax metric space but with an additional constraint: the distance between non-equal points is positive
* in metric space limit of sequence is unique
* forall x. {x} is closed
	* proof
		* forall y. 
			* not (y = x) => d (y, x) > 0
			* hence (open-ball (d (y, x) / 2) y) is an open set containing y and not containing x
		* all these open-balls cover the complement of {x}, without intersecting {x}
		* hence the complement of {x} is open; hence {x} is closed
* all finite sets are closed
	* proof is as in previous theorem
* compactness

* "extreme value theorem"
	* let
		* C be a metric space, compact
		* O be an totally ordered metric space
		* f : C -> O, continuous
	* f attains its extremums
	* proof
		* continuous image of comact set is comact; hence the image of f is bounded, hence it has its extremums
		* suppose that the extremum is not attained; that implies that it is possible to construct an infinite sequence that converges to the extremum
		* the inverse-f image of this sequence, being in a compact space, has a convergent subsequence
		* f is continuous, hence at the limit of this seubsequence it takes the limit of the images of the elements of the sequence, which is the extremum
* norm
