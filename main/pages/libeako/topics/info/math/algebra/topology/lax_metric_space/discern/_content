* the 0-distance point-pairs are not distinguishable by the metric
	* proposition
		* if
			* d (x, y) = 0
		* then
			* forall c
				* d (c, x) = d (c, y)
	* proof
		* by triangle comparison:
		* d (c, x) + d (x, y) >= d (c, y)
		* by eliminating d (x, y), which is 0
		* d (c, x) >= d (c, y)
		* same way for the other comparison direction
* indiscernable (x, y) := d (x, y) = 0
	* is an equivalence relation
		* proof is easy
* implied by all of this: the indiscernable-quotient lax metric space exists and in it the distances between non-equal point-pairs are not zero
