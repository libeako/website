* proposition
	* if
		* M : Set
		* F = { f : M -> Real | f is bounded and continuous }
		* norm-infinite f = sup {foreach (x : M). norm (f x)}
		* d-infinite (f1, f2) := norm-infinite (f1 x - f2 x)
	* then
		* (F, d-infinite) is a complete metric space
* proof
	* of (F, d-infinite) being metric space is easy
	* of completeness is easy via the projections of F to individual points of M
