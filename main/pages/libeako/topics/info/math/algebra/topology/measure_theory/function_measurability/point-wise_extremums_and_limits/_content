* max | min of 2 measurable functions is measurable
	* proof is trivial, as 'max' translates into the union of measurable sets via inverse function image
	* this trivially extends to countable number of functions
* point-wise (supremium | infimum), (limsup | liminf), limit of series of measurable functions is measurable
	* proposition
		* if
			* (T, S, m) measure space
			* f : Nat+ -> T -> Extended Real
				* all measurable
		* then the point-wise (supremium | infimum), (limsup | liminf), limit (if exists) functions of f are measurable
	* proof
		* for (supremum | infimum)
			* take arbitrary (l : Real)
			* those Real (x -> limit f x < l)
			* =
			* those Real (x -> or (those Nat+ (n -> f n x < l)))
			* =
			* union (n -> those Real (x -> f n x < l))
		* for (limit superior) | (limit inferior)
			* g k := (+ k) >>> f
			* forall k. point-wise supremum and infimum of (g k) are measurable
				* this is proved in the 'for (supremum | infimum)' part
			* apply the 'for (supremum | infimum)' part to the infimum and supremum of g
				* point-wise liminf of f is point-wise sup of infs of g
				* point-wise limsup of f is point-wise inf of sups of g
		* for limit [if exists]: limit [if exists] is limsup and liminf, hence this proof is essentially the use of the 'for (limit superior) | (limit inferior)' part
