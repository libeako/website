* let the names of the conversion functions [the witnesses of the isomorphism] be "to-neighborhood" and "to-subset"
* definition of the conversion functions
	* to-neighborhood ss = \ x -> {n : exists o in ss . ({x} <= o) and (o <= n)}
	* to-subset p-n = {o : forall x in o . ({o} <= (p-n x))}
* proofs of conversions to comply with the axioms of the output representations
	* to-neighborhood
		* neighborhood of point contains the point
			* the neighbohood [n] includes o, which contains the point [x]
		* superset of neighborhood is neighborhood
			* the only constraint on neighborhood [n] is (o <= n), which holds for supersets of n too
		* intersection of any 2 neighborhoods is neighborhood
			* the only constraint on neighborhood [n] is (o <= n), which holds for intersections of ns too [being a superset property is kept by intersection]
		* open neighbohood inclusion
			* forall neighborhood n of x
				* exists o:
					* o contains x
						* proof is trivial
					* o <= n
						* proof is trivial
					* n is a neighborhood of all points of o
						* true because o itself is a neighborhood of all of its points
	* to-subset
		* intersection
			* of 0 neighborhoods
				* is the full base set, which is trivially a neighborhood of all points
					* with the choise o = (the full base set)
			* of 2 neighborhoods
				* let the 2 neighborhoods of x be named with "n1" and "n2"
				* let "no" be a function that maps from n to o
				* oi := intersection {no n1, no n2}
				* {oi} <= ss
					* because forall o in {no n1, no n2}: {o} <= ss
				* hence oi is a neighbohood of x, with the choice o = oi
				* intersect {n1, n2} is also a neighborhood of x
					* because o <= intersect {n1, n2}
* proof of being inverses
	* to-neighborhood >>> to-subset = id

		* {m : forall y in m . exists o in ss . ({y} <= o) and (o <= m)} = ss
		* ({m} <= ss) <=> (forall y in m . (exists o in ss . ({y} <= o) and (o <= m))

			* suppose { m } <= ss and { y } <= m
			* we need to prove 
				* exists o in ss . ({y} <= o) and (o <= m)}
					* m is a suitable such o
		* <=
			* let "yo" be a function from y to o, as on the right side of the equivalence
			* u := union { forall y in m . yo y }
			* each o is in ss, hence their union is also in ss [because of one of the axioms of the subsets representation]
			* their union is m, hence
				* u <= m
					* because each o <= m
				* u >= m
					* because each y in m is covered by an o
			* hence m is in ss
