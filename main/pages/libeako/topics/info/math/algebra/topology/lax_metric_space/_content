* name
	* i use the name "lax metric" or "pre-metric" but others mostly use "pseudo-metric"; i refuse to use the "pseudo" prefix because it means 'false', which is not appropriate for this concept; this concept is not a false version of the real metric concept, but only a relaxation of its conditions so that the resultant condition-set is even more elegant in my opinion
* definition
	* (S : Set, d : (S * S) -> Real) is "lax metric" space
	* iff forall x y z in S
		* d (x, x) = 0
			* perhaps the name "reflexivity" can be used
		* d (x, y) = d (y, x)
			* "symmetry"
		* d (x, y) + d (y, z) >= d (x, z)
			* "triangle inequality"
				* i may use "triangle comparison"
* "d" or "dist" or "distance" is the 'metric'
* distance is non-negative

* ball
	* a "ball" with center c and pozitive radius r is 
		* the points p. c (d (c, p)) r
		* where c is a comparison: either (strictly smaller) or (smaller or equal)
		* accordingly the ball is said to be "open" or "closed"
		* notation: ball c r
	* lax metric space induces topology

	* a set n is neighborhood of point p iff exists positive e such that (open-ball e p) is contained by n
		* proof is trivial
	* a set is open iff is union of open balls
		* proof is trivial
* a "net" is a set of points, the proximities of which cover the whole space
	* a 'd-net' is a set of points P so that the (union (lift (ball d) P)) covers the whole space
* boundedness

* Cauchy sequence
	* definition
		* a sequence x is "Cauchy" iff 
		* forall d positive real. exists n natual. forall (n1, n2: (> n)). d (x n1, x n2) < d
	* Cauchy <= convergent
		* proof is trivial
	* iff (Cauchy => convergent) then the space is said to be "complete"
* limit of function
