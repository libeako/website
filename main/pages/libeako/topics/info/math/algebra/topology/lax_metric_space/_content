* name
	* i use the name "lax metric" or "pre-metric" but others mostly use "pseudo-metric"; i refuse to use the "pseudo" prefix because it means 'false', which is not appropriate for this concept; this concept is not a false version of the real metric concept, but only a relaxation of its conditions so that the resultant condition-set is even more elegant in my opinion
* definition
	* (S : Set, d : (S * S) -> R) is "lax metric" space
	* iff forall x y z in S
		* d (x, x) = 0
		* d (x, y) = d (y, x)
		* d (x, y) + d (y, z) >= d (x, z)
* "d" or "dist" or "distance" is the "metric"
* elements of S are said to be the "points" of the space
* reflexive, symmetric, transitive
	* the defining properties of the metric resemble these properties of binary relations; but the metric is a binary function, not a relation
	* but we can derive a relation from it:
		* r (x, y) := d (x, y) = 0
		* it is very easy to derive the reflexive, symmetric, transitive properties of r from the defining properties of d
		* thus
			* these property names can stand for the metric too
				* "transitivity" can be interpreted as transitivity of closeness
					* d (c, x) + d (x, y) >= d (c, y)
					* rearranged:
					* d (x, y) >= d (c, y) - d (c, x)
					* dually:
					* d (x, y) >= d (c, x) - d (c, y)
					* merged:
					* d (x, y) >= abs (d (c, x) - d (c, y))
			* r is an equivalence relation
	* the r-equivalent points are not distinguishable via the metric
		* proposition
			* suppose
				* d (x, y) = 0
			* then forall c.
				* d (c, x) = d (c, y)
		* proof
			* by transitivity:
			* d (c, x) + d (x, y) >= d (c, y)
			* by eliminating d (x, y), which is 0
			* d (c, x) >= d (c, y)
			* same way for the other comparison direction
			* hence the 2 sides are equal
	* hence 
		* the name "indiscernible" is justified instead of r
		* the r-quotient lax metric space exists and in it the distance between non-equal points is not zero [hence it is a metric space]
* distance is non-negative
	* proof
		* 2 * d (x, y)
		* =
			* by symmetry
		* d (x, y) + d (y, x)
		* >=
			* by transitivity
		* d (x, x)
		* =
			* by reflexivity
		* 0
* ball
	* a "ball" with center c and pozitive radius r is 
		* the points p. c (d (c, p)) r
		* where c is a comparison: either strictly smaller or (smaller or equal)
		* accordingly the ball is said to be "open" or "closed"
		* notation: ball c r
	* lax metric space induces a topology
		* open (s : Set) := forall point p in s. exists open-ball with center p and contained by s
		* the set of subsets that are open according to this definition form a topology
			* proof is trivial, because this property is preserved over unions and finite intersections
		* forall point p in an open ball b: exists an open ball around p intirely inside b
			* proof is trivial, using the transitivity property of the metric
		* hence the open balls are open sets in the topology
		* the closed balls are also closed in the topology
			* proof
				* enough to prove that the complementer of any closed ball b is open
				* the complementer points are all at a more than positive distance from the ball, hence some positive sized open ball contains them but not any content of b; hence all the complementer points are covered by open balls, not intersecting b, the union of the small open balls (which is the complementer of b) is open
	* a set n is neighborhood of point p iff exists positive e such that (open-ball e p ) is contained by n
		* proof is trivial
	* a set is open iff is union of open balls
		* proof is trivial
* the empty and full sets are clopen
	* proof is trivial
* a "net" is a set of points, the proximities of which cover the whole space
	* a 'd-net' is a set of points P so that the (union (lift (ball d) P)) covers the whole space
* a subset of a metric space is "bounded" iff exists real number K. forall points x y of the subset. d (x, y) <= K
	* the space is bounded iff its entirety as a subset is bounded
	* when the subset is non-empty then this is equivalent to
		* exists point c. exists real number K. forall point p. d (p, c) <= K
		* proof is trivial
	* a space is "totally bounded" if it is covered by a finite d-net
		* totally bounded => bounded; proof is trivial
* Cauchy sequence
	* definition
		* a sequence x is "Cauchy" iff 
		* forall d positive real. exists n natual. forall n1 n2 (> n). d (x n1, x n2) < d
	* Cauchy <= convergent
		* proof is trivial
	* iff (Cauchy => convergent) then the space is said to be "complete"
* limit of function
	* sequential limit <=> limit
		* proof
			* let "f" mean the function and "x" mean the point where its limit is considered
			* <= is true generally in topological space
			* =>
				* suppose the opposite
					* exists neighborhood ny of y
						* forall neighborhood nx of x
							* exists point p in (nx \ {p})
								* ny does not contain (f p)
				* consider a (converging to zero) radius ball sequence with center x
				* all these balls are neighbohoods of x, hence they contain such p
				* these p points are inside (convering to zero) radius balls around the same center x, hence the sequence "s" of these p points converge to x
				* by assumption that f has a sequential limit at x: (s >>> f) converges to (f x)
				* hence (s >>> f) must step into ny somewhere; but s was constructed specifically to avoid that - this is contradiction
