* name
	* i use the name "lax metric" but others mostly use "pseudo-metric"; i refuse to use the "pseudo" prefix because it means 'false', which is not appropriate for this concept; this concept is not a false version of the real metric concept, but only a relaxation of its conditions so that the resultant condition-set is even more elegant in my opinion
* definition
	* (S : Set, d : (S * S) -> R) is "lax metric" space
	* iff forall x y z in S
		* d (x, x) = 0
		* d (x, y) = d (y, x)
		* d (x, y) + d (y, z) >= d (x, z)
* "d" or "dist" or "distance" is the "metric"
* elements of S are said to be the "points" of the space
* reflexive, symmetric, transitive
	* the defining properties of the metric resemble these properties of binary relations; but the metric is a binary function, not a relation
	* but we can derive a relation from it:
		* r (x, y) := d (x, y) = 0
		* it is very easy to derive the reflexive, symmetric, transitive properties of r from the defining properties of d
		* thus
			* these property names can stand for the metric too
				* "transitivity" can be interpreted as transitivity of closeness
					* (d (x, y) < e) and (d (y, z) < e) => (d (x, z) < 2*e)
			* r is an equivalence relation
	* the r-equivalent points are not distinguishable via the metric
		* proposition
			* suppose
				* d (x, y) = 0
			* then forall c.
				* d (c, x) = d (c, y)
		* proof
			* by transitivity:
			* d (c, x) + d (x, y) >= d (c, y)
			* by eliminating d (x, y), which is 0
			* d (c, x) >= d (c, y)
			* same way for the other comparison direction
			* hence the 2 sides are equal
	* hence 
		* the name "indiscernible" is justified instead of r
		* the r-quotient lax metric space exists
