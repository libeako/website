	* definition
		* dependencies
			* a covering algebra 'R'
			* a volume function (: R -> Extended Non-Negative Real)
		* a "covering" of a set s is a set of sets whose union includes s
		* the size of a set of sets is the sum of the sizes of the sets
			* the order of the summation does not matter because the components are non-negative
				* see absolute convergence of series

		* the "outer measure" of a set is the infimum of the sizes of all the countable coverings of the set
			* the name is from the fact that this construction is an approximation from the outside
			* the result of such construction may be not a real measure, hence the name is misleading
		* an "inner measure" can also be defined dually [by supremum of sizes of covered set-sets]
	* properties
		* the good property of outer measure is that it can be constructed from any subset of sets and initial set-volume-function
		* the outer measure of empty sets is zero
			* proof: empty sets are covered by empty sets of sets
		* an outer measure is monotone
			* proof is trivial, because a covering of a set is also a covering for all smaller sets
		* an outer measure is countably [and finitely] sub-additive
			* proof
				* i deal with the countable subadditivity only, because the proof of the finite subadditivity is the same but simpler
				* if any set component of the summation have size infinite then the proposed comparison is true trivially; otherwise:
				* the series of the sizes of the set-components is absolutely convergent; hence it can be rearranged arbitrarily
				* let us fix an order of them
					* sn : Nat -> Set
				* take an arbitrary positive number e
				* the size is an outer measure, hence we can choose arbitrarily tight coverings for each set-component:
					* covering n := a covering c of (sn n) such that
						* size c - size (sn n) < e * (power n (1 / 2))
				* these bounds of the distances ["closenesses"] is decreasing exponentially, hence their sum is finite and arbitrarily small, hence
				* (the sum of the sizes of the set-components) is arbitrarily close to (the sum of the sizes of the coverings)
				* sum (sizes of the coverings) = size (the union of the coverings)
					* by the definition of (size of covering)
				* size (the union of the coverings) >= size (the union of the sets)
					* as the union of these coverings is a covering of the union
				* summary: 
					* size (the union of the sets) - the sum of the sizes of the sets < <arbitrarily small positive number>
					* which implies the <= relationship between them
* "outerish measure"

	* other sources use the name "outer measure", but i think we should reserve that for the 'outer measure construction'
	* the "measure" in the name is misleading because it may be not a real measure
	* definition
		* by "outerish measure" i mean a conjunction of properties:
			* maps 0 to the empty set
			* is monotone increasing
			* is countably and finitely subadditive
		* which are characteristic of set-functions constructed with
			* the 'outer' method
