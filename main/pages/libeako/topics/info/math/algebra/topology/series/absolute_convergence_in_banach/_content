* let
	* V be a normed vector space
	* s : Nat -> x
* (series s is absolutely convergent => series s is convergent) <=> space is complete
* proof
	* <=
		* this direction is easy
		* take an absolutely converget series s
		* series (lift norm s) is Cauchy
		* sum (lift (s >>> norm) (from _ to _)) is diminishing
		* hence, using the triangular inequality of norm
		* norm (sum (lift s (from _ to _))) is diminishing
		* hence s as a series is Cauchy
		* hence, using the assumption that the space is complete
		* s as a series is convergent
