			* proof
				* if norm x >= 1 then is divergent, obviously
				* if norm x < 1 then
					* the partial sums of geometric series are
						* fun n x -> (1 - power n x) / (1 - x)
						* see formula
							\ links-to internal kmpydpduqwlgygzj
					* this converges to (1 / (1 - x)) as n converges to infinity
* the set of values ["x"] where the power series is convergent is the "sphere of convergence"
	* the norm is multiplicative => this set is really a sphere
		* proof
			* let g be in the set of convergence
			* then it is enough to prove
				* forall s. (norm (s - c) < norm (g - c)) => s is in the set of convergence
			* the following is this proof
			* convergent series is bounded
			* hence {forall n in Nat+. (norm ((coeff n) * power n (g - c)))} is bounded; let us name one bound with b
			* r := ((s - c) / (g - c))
			* norm r < 1
			* we here study the convergence of
				* series (fun n -> norm (coeff n * power n (s - c)))
			* s - c = r * (g - c)
			* norm (coeff n * power n (s - c)) =
			* norm (coeff n * power n (r * (g - c))) =
				* move r out
			* norm (coeff n * power n (g - c)) * norm (power n r) <=
			* b * norm (power n r)
			* (flip power r) is the geometric sequence, whose series is convergent iff (norm r < 1) and the norm is multiplicative
				* these conditions are fulfilled here
		* if (fun n -> norm (coeff (n + 1) / coeff n)) converges [perhaps to an infinity]
			* proposition
				* let the limit of this sequence be l
				* then the radius of convergence is (1 / l)
			* proof is by application of the
				* ratio test
