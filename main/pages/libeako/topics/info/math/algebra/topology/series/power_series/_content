			* proof
				* the partial sums of geometric series are
					* n x -> (1 - power n x) / (1 - x)
					* see formula
						\ links-to internal kmpydpduqwlgygzj
					* if norm x < 1 then this converges to (1 / (1 - x)) as n converges to infinity
					* if norm x >= 1 then this is divergent, as is not Cauchy
* the set of values where the power series is convergent is the "sphere of convergence"
