* i may treat convergently compactness as the main form of compactness
	* i may use the simple "compact" term for it
		* because
			* though they mean different things in general topolgy
			* in metric space the 2 notions are equivalent
				* i do not prove this
* theorem
	* proposition
		* the following versions of compactness are equivalent: convergental [C], accumulative [A], limit point [L]
	* proof
		* C => A
			* take the subsequence that is convergent, then trivial
		* A => L
			* take an arbitrary infinite set
			* create an infinite sequence of it
				* this is possible because it is possible to create any but finite length such sequence
				* the elements of the sequence come from a set, hence they are all different
			* by [A] exists point p. forall neighborhood n of p. almost all of the sequence is element of n
			* almost all of the sequence is an infinite amount of points; we also know they are all different => exist one of them which is not p - hence p is limit point
		* L => C
			* take an arbitrary infinite sequence
			* take its set of elements; by assumption [L] it has a limit point; let the name of this point be p
			* p being limit point = forall neighborhood n of p. exists x in n and not equal to p
			* choose one such x point from all of 
				* lift (ball p) (divide 1 : N+ -> R)
					* this is where the fact is used that the space is metric [the existence of the balls]
			* take a sub-sequence of this sequence of points which is descending in distance from p; this sub-sequence converges to p
* theorem: compact <=> (complete and totally bounded)
	* proof
		* sub-theorem: compact space is complete
			* take an arbitrary Cauchy sequence
			* the space is [convergently] compact, hence this sequence has a convergent subsequence; let us name the limit by "p"
			* a Cauchy sequence can have at most one accumulation point, hence the whole sequence converges to p, hence the space is complete
		* sub-theorem: compact space is totally bounded
			* suppose the opposite: exists d. not exists finite d-net cover
			* keep selecting points from the space so that do not select from the points already covered by some d-ball with an already selected point as center
			* the result is such an infinite sequence of points that the distance of each pair of points >= d; hence this sequence is not Cauchy; hence it does not contain a convergent sub-sequence; hence the space is not compact; this contradicts the initial assumption; hence the space is totally bounded
		* sub-theorem: (complete and totally bounded) => compact
			* sub-sub-theorem: totally bounded => every sequence has a Cauchy sub-sequence
				* take an arbitrary sequence
				* forall d > 0. exists finite d-net which covers the whole space
				* because of its finiteness: at least 1 of the balls covers infinite number of points of the sequence; this is a subsequence in which the distance of all point-paris < d / 2; hence this subsequence is Cauchy
			* by the assumption of the theorem: the space is complete; hence, as Cauchy, every subsequence converges; hence the space is compact
