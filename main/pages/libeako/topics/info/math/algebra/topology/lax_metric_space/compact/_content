* compact <=> (complete and totally bounded)
	* proof
		* sub-theorem: compact space is complete
			* take an arbitrary Cauchy sequence
			* the space is [convergently] compact, hence this sequence has a convergent subsequence; let us name the limit by "p"
			* the Cauchy property constrains the whole sequence to converge to p, hence the space is complete
		* sub-theorem: compact space is totally bounded

		* sub-theorem: (complete and totally bounded) => compact
			* sub-sub-theorem: totally bounded => every sequence has a Cauchy sub-sequence
				* take an arbitrary sequence
				* forall d > 0
					* exists finite d-net which covers the whole space
					* because of its finiteness: at least 1 of the balls covers infinite number of points of the sequence; this is a subsequence in which the distance of all point-paris < d / 2
				* hence the subsequence selected with this method is Cauchy
			* by the assumption of the theorem: the space is complete; hence, as Cauchy, every subsequence converges; hence the space is compact
* function: continuous on compact => uniformly continuous
