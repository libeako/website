* proposition
	* the norm is multiplicative => the set of values ["x"] where a power series is convergent is a sphere and inside it the series is absolutely convergent
* proof
	* it is trivial to reduce the proposition to the special case when c is the origo; the following is a proof of only this
	* it is enough to prove
		* forall s g. (norm s < norm g) and the series is convergent at g => the series is convergent absolutely at s
	* proof of it
		* convergent series is Causchy-convergent, hence its components are bounded
		* hence {forall n in Nat+. (norm ((coeff n) * power n g))} is bounded; let us name one bound with b
		* r := s / g
		* we here study the convergence of
			* series (n -> norm (coeff n * power n s))
		* s = r * g
		* norm (coeff n * power n s) =
		* norm (coeff n * power n (r * g))
		* =
			* move r out
		* norm (coeff n * power n g) * norm (power n r) <= b * norm (power n r)
		* (flip power r) is the geometric sequence, whose series is convergent absolutely if (norm r < 1) which is true here
* calculation of the radius of convergence
	* with the ratio test
		* see the ratio test

		* if the limit exists
			* l := limit (lift1 (/) ((+ 1) >>> coeff) coeff)
			* the radius of convergence is (1 / l)
	* with the root test
		* see the root test

		* l := lim-sup (lift2 power (1 /) (coeff >>> norm))
		* then the radius of convergence is (1 / l)
