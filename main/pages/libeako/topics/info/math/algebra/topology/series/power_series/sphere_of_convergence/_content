* proposition
	* the norm is multiplicative => the set of values ["x"] where the power series is convergent is a sphere and inside it the series is absolutely convergent
* proof
	* it is trivial to reduce the proposition to the special case when c is the origo; the following is a proof of only this
	* if the set of convergence is empty than the proposition is trivially true; otherwise:
	* rad := sup { for g at where the series is convergent. norm g }
	* norm s < rad => the series is absolutely convergent at s
		* proof
			* let g be in the set of convergence and norm s < norm g < rad
			* convergent series is bounded
			* hence {forall n in Nat+. (norm ((coeff n) * power n g))} is bounded; let us name one bound with b
			* r := s / g
			* we here study the convergence of
				* series (fun n -> norm (coeff n * power n s))
			* s = r * g
			* norm (coeff n * power n s) =
			* norm (coeff n * power n (r * g))
			* =
				* move r out
			* norm (coeff n * power n g) * norm (power n r) <=
			* b * norm (power n r)
			* (flip power r) is the geometric sequence, whose series is convergent if (norm r < 1) which is true here
	* if rad is +infinity then the proposition is trivially true [the series is absolutely convergent everywhere]; otherwise:
	* if norm s > rad then the series is divergent at s, by definition of rad
	* if (fun n -> norm (coeff (n + 1) / coeff n)) converges [perhaps to an infinity]
* 
	* proposition
		* let the limit of this sequence be l
		* then the radius of convergence is (1 / l)
	* proof is by application of the
		* ratio test
