* proposition
	* if
		* (M, d) lax metric space
		* S <= M
			* S is sequentially compact
		* C : a set of open sets covering S
	* then
		* exists r > 0. forall (x : S). (open-ball r x) is included in some element of C
* proof by contradition
	* suppose
		* forall r > 0. exists (x : S). (open-ball r x) is not included in any element of C
	* then
		* exists (x : Nat+ -> S). forall (n : Nat+). (open-ball (1 / n) (x n)) is not included in any element of C
		* S is sequentially compact, hence x has subsequence converging to an element of S:
		* exists (k : Nat+ -> Nat+) (p : S). (k >>> x) converges to p
		* C is a covering of S, hence exists (O in C). O contains p
		* O is open, hence exists r > 0. O includes (open-ball r p)
		* choose (n : Nat+) big enough such that
			* z : = x (k n)
			* d (p, z) < r / 3
				* this can be done as (k >>> x) converges to p
			* 1 / (k n) < r / 3
				* then (open-ball (r / 3) z) is not included in any element of C
		* but O does include (open-ball (r / 3) z)
			* as
				* O contains (open-ball r p)
				* d (p, z) < r / 3
