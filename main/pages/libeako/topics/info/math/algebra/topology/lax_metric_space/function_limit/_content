* sequential limit <=> limit
	* <= is true generally in topological space
	* proof of =>
		* let "f" mean the function and "x" mean the point where its limit is considered
		* suppose the opposite
			* forall sequence s. s converges to x => (s >>> f) converges to y
			* f does not converges to y at x
				* exists neighborhood ny of y
					* forall neighborhood nx of x
						* exists point p in (nx \ {x})
							* ny does not contain (f p)
		* consider a (converging to zero) radius ball sequence with center x
		* all these balls are neighbohoods of x, hence they contain such p
		* these p points are inside (convering to zero) radius balls around the same center x, hence the sequence "s" of these p points converge to x
		* by assumption that f has a sequential limit at x: (s >>> f) converges to y
		* hence (s >>> f) must step into ny somewhere; but s was constructed specifically to avoid that - this is contradiction
