* proof
	* take arbitrary
		* (t, b, _) measure space
			* t topological space
			* b contains the Borel sigma algebra of t
		* f : t -> Real
			* continuous
		* l : Real
	* for the measurability we need to prove that the inverse image of [-infinity .. l) is measurable
	* f does not have -infinity as value; hence [-infinity .. l) = (-infinity .. l)
	* which is open
	* inverse image of open set is open

	* open sets are in the Borel sigma algebra b, hence open sets are measurable
