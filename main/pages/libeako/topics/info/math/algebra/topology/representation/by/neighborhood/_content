* the neighborhood representation of topology is a function from points to its neighborhoods
* let S be the base type
* neighborhoods : S -> Set (S -> Bool)
	* forall point x
		* (neighborhood x) are the "neighborhoods" of x
		* all neighborhoods of x contains x
		* forall neighborhood n of x: all supersets of n are also neighborhoods of n
		* the intersection of 2 neighborhood of x is a neighborhood of x
		* forall neighborhood n of x
			* exists o: 
				* o contains x
				* o <= n
				* n is a neighborhood of all points of o
