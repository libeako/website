* meaning
	* let
		* (+) : T -> T 
			* associative
		* e : N -> T
	* series e n := fold (+) {forall i in {1, ..., n}. (e n)}
	* the 'series' function transforms a sequence into another sequence, into the folding of the corresponding beginning of the input sequence, into the sequence of partial sums
* a 'series is convergent' iff it is convergent as a sequence
* rearrange
	* associativity does not necessarily extend to infinite arguments
		* the binary (+) is associative, that is a requirement for the interpretation of 'series'; but a series is an (+) with infinite arguments
		* example
			* 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 ...
			* (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) ... = 0
			* 1 + (- 1 + 1) + (- 1 + 1) + ... = 1 + 0 = 1
	* "unconditional convergence"
		* when all orderings of the series converges and to the same limit
		* a series s is 'absolutely convergent' iff series (lift norm s) is convergent
			* (absolutely convergent => convergent) <=> space is complete

	* "conditional convergence"
		* when the series is convergent but not absolutely convergent
