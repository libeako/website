	* let
		* (+) : T -> T 
			* associative
		* e : N -> T
	* front-sums e n := fun n -> fold (+) {forall i in {1, ..., n}. (e n)}
	* the 'front-sums' function transforms a sequence into another sequence, into the folding of the corresponding beginning of the input sequence, into the sequence of the frontal partial sums
	* i may use 'series e' as the series with the components of the sequence e but interpreted as a sequence
* the convergence and the limit of a series is the same as of the sequence of its frontal sums
* rearrange [absolute convergence]

* the Cauchy product of 2 serieses is a series with components that are the diagonals of the input serieses as laid out as 2 dimensional grid
	* if the input serieses are absolutely convergent then the Cauchy product is absolutely convergent
		* proof: it is monotone increasing and upper-bound by the product of the limits of the input serieses
