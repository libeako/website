* meaning
	* let
		* (+) : T -> T 
			* associative
		* e : N -> T
	* front-sums e n := fun n -> fold (+) {forall i in {1, ..., n}. (e n)}
	* the 'front-sums' function transforms a sequence into another sequence, into the folding of the corresponding beginning of the input sequence, into the sequence of the frontal partial sums
	* i may use 'series e' as the series with the components of the sequence e but interpreted as a sequence
* the convergence and the limit of a series is the same as of the sequence of its frontal sums
* rearrange
	* associativity does not necessarily extend to infinite arguments
		* the binary (+) is associative, that is a requirement for the interpretation of 'series'; but a series is an (+) with infinite arguments
		* example
			* 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 ...
			* (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) ... = 0
			* 1 + (- 1 + 1) + (- 1 + 1) + ... = 1 + 0 = 1
	* "unconditional convergence"
		* when all orderings of the series converges and to the same limit
		* a series s is 'absolutely convergent' iff series (lift norm s) is convergent
			* a better name would probably be 'convergenence normedly'
			* (absolutely convergent => convergent) <=> space is complete

			* absolute convergent series converges to the same limit with any order
				* proof
					* take 2 arbitrary orders
					* take 2 big head sections of them, so big that all the head sections of the remaining tail sections are infinitesimally small, absolutely
					* take the union of these head sections
						* this must be infinitesimally close to both head sections, hence those head sections must be infinitesimally close together
			* uncountable sum
				* the sum of uncountably infinite number of positive numbers can be defined as the supremums of the sums of all finite subsets
					* we can extend this definition to negative numbers too, by separating the positive and negative elements of the set and processing them parallelly
				* Tonelli's theorem
					* proposition
						* if
							* f : T1 * T2 -> ExtendedReal+
						* then
							* sum f = sum (fun x1 -> sum (fun x2 -> f (x1, x2)))
					* proof is easy
	* "conditional convergence"
		* when the series is convergent but not unconditionally convergent
* the Cauchy product of 2 serieses is a series with components that are the diagonals of the input serieses as laid out as 2 dimensional grid
	* if the input serieses are absolutely convergent then the Cauchy product is absolutely convergent
		* proof: it is monotone increasing and upper-bound by the product of the limits of the input serieses
