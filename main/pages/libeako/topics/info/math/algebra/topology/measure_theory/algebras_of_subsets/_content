	* sources differ much on the definition of "semi-algebra"
	* definition: a set of sets such that
		* has binary intersection
		* complementer is semi-closed
			* forall member sets. its complementer is a finite union of member sets
* "algebra"s are algebras having proper complementer method and intersections of not too many sets
	* having proper complementer method makes requirements for either union or intersection equivalent to each other
	* a "covering algebra" of subsets is one which contains the intersection of 0 number of subsets
		* the result of such [0-argument] intersection is the full base set
		* hence it contains {} too, via the complementer
		* an 'algebra of sets' is a covering algebra which can union and intersection finite number of subsets
			* algebras are semialgebras too
			* building one from a semi-algebra
