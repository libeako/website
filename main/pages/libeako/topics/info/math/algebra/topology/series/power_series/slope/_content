	* this theorem is about the radius of convergence of power series, which is invariant of the center of the power series; hence it is not a loss of generality to assume (center = origo)
	* proposition
		* if
			* z : Complex
			* s : Nat+ -> Complex
			* r is the radius of convergence of (series (from 0) (n -> s n  * power n z))
		* then
			* r is also the radius of convergence of
				* series (from 1) (n -> s n * n * power (n - 1) z)
				* series (from 0) (n -> (s n / (n+1)) * power (n+1) z)
	* proof of convergence

* each power-series is term-wise integrable and differentiable
	* proof
		* the key is the observation of
			* term-wise integration and differentiation keep the spehere of radius

		* being convergent power serieses: they converge uniformly on compact subsets of the sphere of convergence
			* see theorem

		* more down-to-earth proofs are possible too, but they are more complex and less elegant
			* here are ones for the differentiability
