* proposition
	* if
		* (S : Set) is sequentially compact
	* then
		* forall e > 0. exists finite e-net covering S
* proof by contradiction
	* assume the opposite
	* e > 0, ne finite covering e-net
	* then exists (x : Nat+ -> S)
		* (x 0) is any point of S
		* (x 1) is any point of (S \ open-ball e (x 0))
		* (x 2) is any point of (S \ open-ball e (x 0) \ open-ball e (x 1))
		* ...
		* infinitely, otherwise this would be a finite e-net
	* by the construction of x: the distance between any 2 components of x is at least e; hence x does not have a convergent subsequence; this contradicts assumption
