* (C, d-infinite) := the metric space of bounded continous real functions
	\ links-to internal gjygcmzlozsrdrgg
* proposition
	* if
		* (M, d) is a metric space
	* then
		* it has a completion 
			* with other words: a metric space exists that contains a complete metric space that is isomorphic to (M, d)
* proof
	* g o m := curry d m - curry d o
		* expresses how much further is a point from m than from o
		* foreach (o : M)
			* g o is injective
			* foreach (m1 : M) (m2 : M)
				* d (m1, m2)
				* = 
					* by triangular comparison
				* norm-infinite (g o m1 - g o m2) = d-infinite (g o m1, g o m2)
	* thus M is isomorphic to 
		* a subset of (C, d-infinite)
			* let its name be "MC"
	* C is complete metric space, hence the closure of MC is also in C and is complete
