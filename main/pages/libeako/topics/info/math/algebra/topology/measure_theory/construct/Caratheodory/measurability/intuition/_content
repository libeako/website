* this is about the meaning of the Carathéodory condition
* the equation in it refers to 2 sets: the subject set [the set whose measurability is the question] and a test set [over which the condition is universally quantified]
* the subject set divides the test set to 2 parts: one with the points common with the subject set and the other is the rest
* the equation says that the size of the test set equals to the sum of the sizes of those 2 parts of it
	* this can be interpreted as either
		* the subject set interacts with the test set nicely
		* clean border
			* the subject set divides the test set cleanly; with other phrasing: the dividing border between the 2 partitions is clean; that border is a segment of the border of the subject set; hence the condition can be interpreted as the border of the subject set being clean everywhere
			* "clean" means that it is approximatable perfectly [without gap] with unions of elementary sets
			* other source
