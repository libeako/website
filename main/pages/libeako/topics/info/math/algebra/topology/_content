* "clopen" means (open and closed)
* theorem: the extremal sets are clopen
	* the empty set is open
		* because it is the union of zero open sets
	* the full set is open
		* because it is the intersection of zero open sets
	* hence the full and the empty sets are closed
		* because they are the complements of the empty and full sets, which are open
	* hence both extremal sets are both open and closed
* the "neighborhood" of a set s is a set which has an open subset which includes s
* the "neighborhood" of a point x is a neighborhood of {x}
* theorem: n is neighborhood of set s <=> n is neighborhood of all points of s
	* =>: trivial
	* <=: use the property that the union of open sets is open
* theorem: s is open <=> s is neighborhood of itself
	* proof is trivial
* the "interior" of a set
	* definition
		* intuitively
			* x is interior point of s iff x has a neighborhood included by s
		* this is equivalent to (the union of its open subsets of s)
			* proof is trivial
		* theorem: the interior of s is the greatest open subset included by s
			* proof is trivial
	* the "exterior" of a set means the interior of its complement
		* the points of the exterior are the "exterior point"s
		* x is an "isolated" point of s means that x is exterior of s\{x}
	* dually: the "adherent" points of a set are the ones that have neighborhood that contains point of the set
		* this is equivalent to (the intersection of the closed sets including the set)
		* the closure of a set s is (the smallest closed set which includes s)
			* thus it is said to be the "closure" of s
* theorem: is open = equals to its interior

	* with other words: the open sets are exactly those which equal to their interior
	* proof is trivial
	* dually: is closed = equals to its closure
* "cluster" or "accumulation" or "limit" point of a set
	* intuitively these are the ones that have other points of the set arbitrariy close
		* more formally: x is limit point of s iff all neighborhoof of x contains other than x point from s
	* theorem: this is equivalent to (border points are the not isolated adherent points)
		* proof is easy
	* the "derived" set of a set is the set of its limit points
* theorem: the points of a closing of a set can be partitioned to its limit and isolated points
	* proof is easy: the points [of the closing] either do or do not have other points of the set in all of their neighborhoods
* "border points"
	* intuitively these are the points which are arbitrarily close to both the set and its complement
	* more formally
		* a point x is in the border of set s iff all neighborhood of x contains point both from s and its complement
	* this is directly equivalent to the point not being either in the interior or exterior of s
	* this is equivalent to being in the complement of the interior and exterior of s, that is in the intersection of the closure of s and the closure of the complement of s
	* we can mix the 2 formulations: one part can come from being in the closure of one of the 2 complementing sets and not being in the interior of the other: a point x is in the border of set s iff x is in the closure of s and not in the exterior of s
	* theorem: the union of a set with its border is the closure of the set
		* poof is easy
	* theorem: set is open iff does not intersect with its boundary
		* proof is trivial
* a sequence "converges" to point l iff forall its neighborhood n. almost all elements of the sequence are in n
