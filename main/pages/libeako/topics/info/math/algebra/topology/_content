* "clopen" means (open and closed)
* theorem: the extremal sets are clopen
	* the empty set is open
		* because it is the union of zero open sets
	* the full set is open
		* because it is the intersection of zero open sets
	* hence the full and the empty sets are closed
		* because they are the complements of the empty and full sets, which are open
	* hence both extremal sets are both open and closed
* the "neighborhood" of a set s is a set which has an open subset which includes s
* the "neighborhood" of a point x is a neighborhood of {x}
	* a neighborhood n of x without x [n \ {x}] is a "deleted" or "punctured" neighborhood of x
* theorem: n is neighborhood of set s <=> n is neighborhood of all points of s
	* =>: trivial
	* <=: use the property that the union of open sets is open
* theorem: s is open <=> s is neighborhood of itself
	* proof is trivial
* the "interior" of a set
	* definition
		* intuitively
			* x is interior point of s iff x has a neighborhood included by s
		* this is equivalent to (the union of its open subsets of s)
			* proof is trivial
		* theorem: the interior of s is the greatest open subset included by s
			* proof is trivial
	* the "exterior" of a set means the interior of its complement
		* the points of the exterior are the "exterior point"s
		* x is an "isolated" point of s means that x is exterior of s\{x}
	* dually: the "adherent" points of a set are the ones around which all neighborhoods contain point of the set
		* this is equivalent to (the intersection of the closed sets including the set)
		* the closure of a set s is (the smallest closed set which includes s)
			* thus it is said to be the "closure" of s
* theorem: is open = equals to its interior

	* with other words: the open sets are exactly those which equal to their interior
	* proof is trivial
	* dually: is closed = equals to its closure
* theorem: the points of a closing of a set can be partitioned to its limit and isolated points
	* proof is easy: the points [of the closing] either do or do not have other points of the set in all of their neighborhoods
* "cluster" or "accumulation" or "limit" point of a set
	* intuitively these are the ones that have other points of the set arbitrariy close
		* more formally: x is limit point of s iff all neighborhood of x contains other than x point from s
	* the "derived" set of a set is the set of its limit points
* "border points"
	* intuitively these are the points which are arbitrarily close to both the set and its complement
	* more formally
		* a point x is in the border of set s iff all neighborhood of x contains point both from s and its complement
	* this is directly equivalent to the point not being either in the interior or exterior of s
	* this is equivalent to being in the complement of the interior and exterior of s, that is in the intersection of the closure of s and the closure of the complement of s
	* we can mix the 2 formulations: one part can come from being in the closure of one of the 2 complementing sets and not being in the interior of the other: a point x is in the border of set s iff x is in the closure of s and not in the exterior of s
	* theorem: the union of a set with its border is the closure of the set
		* poof is easy
	* theorem: set is open iff does not intersect with its boundary
		* proof is trivial
* infinite sequence
	* an infinite sequence "converges" to its "limit" point l iff forall [open] neighborhood n of l. almost all elements of the sequence are in n
	* an "accumulation" point of a sequence is one all [open] neighborhoods of which contain infinite elements of the sequence
	* theorem: the limit point of a sequence is an accumulation point of the sequence
		* proof is trivial
* "limit" of function f at point x is y iff
	* forall neirhborhood nx of x. exists neighborhood ny of y. forall point p in (nx \ {x}). f p is in ny
		* this could have been phrased with open neighborhoods only, that is equivalent
* "sequential limit" of function f at point x is y iff
	* forall sequence s that converges to x and does not contain x. (s >>> f) converges to y

* compactness
	\ id ecmltgeunwukoeeb
	* a space S is "compact" iff all open covers of S have a finite sub-cover
		* an open "cover" of S is a set of open sets whose union contains S
		* a sub-cover is a subset which is also cover
	* a space is "accumulatively" compact iff all sequencies have an accumulation point in the space
		* this name is my invention; others use the name "countably compact"
	* a subset H of a space is "convergently compact" iff all infinite sequences of H contain subsequence which converges in H
		* the name "convergently compact" is my invention
			* i do not like the name "sequentially compact" because it does not involve the sequence notion more than the countably compactness does
		* theorem: compact => convergently compact
			* proof: countably finite sequence is sequence
	* a space is "limit point compact" iff any infinite subset of the points have a limit point in the space
* basis
	* definition
		* a subset B of the set of open sets is "basis" of the topology iff all open sets are unions of members of B
	* example: the open intervals are a basis of the standard real numbers topology
	* the elements of a basis are the "basic" open sets of the topology
	* a subset B of the open sets is "subbasis" ["subbase", "prebase", "prebasis"] iff the topology is the smallest which contains B as open sets
		* then B "generates" the topology
		* this is the same as iff (all the open sets are generatable from B by the topological methods [union, finite intersection])
		* every base is a subbase
* lax metric space
