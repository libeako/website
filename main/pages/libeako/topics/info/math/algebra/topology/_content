* "clopen" means (open and closed)
* theorem: the extremest sets are clopen
	* the empty set is open
		* because it is the union of zero open sets
	* the full set is open
		* because it is the intersection of zero open sets
	* hence the full and the empty sets are closed
		* because they are the complements of the empty and full sets, which are open
	* hence both extremal sets are both open and closed
* a "neighborhood" of a set s is a set which has an open subset which includes s
* a "neighborhood" of a point x is a neighborhood of {x}
	* a neighborhood n of x without x [n \ {x}] is a "deleted" or "punctured" neighborhood of x
* theorem: n is neighborhood of set s <=> n is neighborhood of all points of s
	* =>: trivial
	* <=: use the property that the union of open sets is open
* theorem: s is open <=> s is neighborhood of itself
	* proof is trivial
* the "interior" of a set
	* definition
		* intuitively
			* x is interior point of s iff x has a neighborhood included by s
		* this is equivalent to (the union of the open subsets of s)
			* proof is trivial
		* theorem: the interior of s is the greatest open subset included by s
			* proof is trivial
	* the "exterior" of a set means the interior of its complement
		* the points of the exterior are the "exterior point"s
		* x is an "isolated" point of s means that x is exterior of s\{x}
	* the "opening" of a set is its interior
		* this word is not used though widely, because "interior" exists
	* dually: the "adherent" points of a set are the ones around which all neighborhoods contain point of the set
		* this is equivalent to (the intersection of those closed sets that include the set)
			* proof is trivial with a chain of equivalent [negated] propositions about a point and base set 's'
				* is not in the intersection of all s-covering closed sets
				* is not in at least one s-covering closed set
				* is in the complementer of that s-covering closed set
				* is in a set that is open and does not intersect s
				* has neighborhood that does not intersect s
		* hence a set is closed iff contains all its adherent points
			* dually: a set is open iff does not contain any adherent point of its complementer
		* the closure of a set s is (the smallest closed set which includes s)
			* thus it is said to be the "closure" of s
* theorem: is open = equals to its interior

	* proof is trivial
	* dually: is closed = equals to its closure
* "limit" or "dense" or "cluster" or "accumulation" point of a set
	* intuitively these are the ones that have other points of the set arbitrarily close
		* more formally: x is limit point of s iff all neighborhood of x contains other than x point from s
	* name
		* "dense" is not used by others, only by me
		* i think all of "cluster" or "accumulation" or "limit" are bad, they do not fit well to the concept
		* 'dense set' for me is one whose all points are dense
			* i know that others use 'dense set' with different meaning, which i think is not intuitive
	* the "derived" set of a set is the set of its limit points
		* horrible name choice; perhaps "dense variant" would be better
* theorem: the points of a closure of a set can be partitioned to its limit and isolated points
	* proof is easy: the points [of the closure] either do or do not have other points of the set in all of their neighborhoods
* "border points"
	* intuitively these are the points which are arbitrarily close to both the set and its complement
	* more formally
		* a point x is in the border of set s iff all neighborhood of x contains point both from s and its complement
	* this is directly equivalent to the point not being either in the interior or exterior of s
	* this is equivalent to being in the complement of the interior and exterior of s, that is in the intersection of the closure of s and the closure of the complement of s
	* we can mix the 2 formulations: one part can come from being in the closure of one of the 2 complementing sets and not being in the interior of the other: a point x is in the border of set s iff x is in the closure of s and not in the exterior of s
	* theorem: the union of a set with its border is the closure of the set
		* poof is easy
	* theorem: set is open iff does not intersect with its boundary
		* proof is trivial
* function f at point x "converges to" y iff
	* forall neighborhood ny of y. exists neighborhood nx of x. forall point p in (nx \ {x}). (f p) is in ny
		* this could have been phrased with open neighborhoods only, that is equivalent
			* proof is trivial
	* an other phrase is "limit of function f at point x is y"
	* special case is when the domain of the function is the extended natural numbers, the topology is the order topology and the point of focus is the infinity; then the function is a "sequence" and we say that "the sequence converges" to y
	* "limit {inferior, superior}"
		* let 
			* T be a topological space
			* M be totally ordered
			* f : T -> M
			* x be a point of T
		* lim-inf f x := inf {forall n non-empty deleted neighborhood of x. sup {forall p in n. f p}}
			* may not exist
		* lim-sup is dual of lim-inf
		* theorem: lim-inf and lim-sup exist <=> (f at x converges to l <=> lim-inf = lim-sup = l)
			* proof is easy
* infinite sequence
	* an infinite sequence "converges" to its "limit" point l iff forall [open] neighborhood n of l. almost all elements of the sequence are in n
	* an "accumulation" point of a sequence is one all [open] neighborhoods of which contain infinite elements of the sequence
	* theorem: the limit point of a sequence is an accumulation point of the sequence
		* proof is trivial
* "sequential limit" of function f at point x is y iff
	* definition
		* forall sequence s that converges to x and does not contain x
			* (s >>> f) converges to y
	* the limit of f at x is y => the sequential limit of f at x is y
		* proof is trivial
		* other sources say that the other direction is false

* basis
	* definition
		* a subset B of the set of open sets is "basis" of the topology iff all open sets are unions of members of B
	* example: the open intervals are a basis of the standard real numbers topology
	* the elements of a basis are the "basic" open sets of the topology
	* a subset B of the open sets is "subbasis" ["subbase", "prebase", "prebasis"] iff the topology is the smallest which contains B as open sets
		* then B "generates" the topology
		* this is the same as iff (all the open sets are generatable from B by the topological methods [union, finite intersection])
		* every base is a subbase
* an "order topology" is one generated by a subbase of "open rays"
	* an open ray is like {x | x > a}

	* "Alex Küronya : Introduction to Topology"
		* i read only a small portion of this book, but it seems good; compact, understandable
	* "Huỳnh Quang Vũ : Lecture notes on Topology"
		* i did not read this book but seems good. It seems to concentrate onto only the most important things, gives a very wide coverage.
