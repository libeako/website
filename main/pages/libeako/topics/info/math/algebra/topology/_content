* "clopen" means (open and closed)
* theorem: the extremal sets are clopen
	* the empty set is open
		* because it is the union of zero open sets
	* the full set is open
		* because it is the intersection of zero open sets
	* hence the full and the empty sets are closed
		* because they are the complements of the empty and full sets, which are open
	* hence both extremal sets are both open and closed
* theorem: is open = equals to its interior

	* with other words: the open sets are exactly those which equal to their interior
	* proof is trivial
	* dually: is closed = equals to its closure
* the "neighborhood" of a set s is a set which has an open subset which includes s
* the "neighborhood" of a point x is a neighborhood of {x}
* theorem: n is neighborhood of set s <=> n is neighborhood of all points of s
	* =>: trivial
	* <=: use the property that the union of open sets is open
* theorem: s is open <=> s is neighborhood of itself
	* proof is trivial
* the "interior" of a set means the union of its open subsets
	* theorem: the interior of s is the greates open open subset included by s
		* proof is trivial
	* the points of an interior are the "interior point"s
		* theorem: x is interior point of s iff x has an open neighborhood included by s
			* proof is trivial
	* the "exterior" of a set means the interior of its complement
		* the points of the exterior are the "exterior point"s
	* dually: the "closure" of a set means the intersection of the closed sets which include it
		* theorem: the closure of a set is the smallest closed set which includes s
		* the points of a closure are the "adherent" points
	* x is an "isolated" point of s means that x is exterior of s\{x}
* the "limit" points are the not isolated adherent points
	* theorem: this is equivalent to all neighborhoods of it containing point of s other than it
		* proof is easy
	* the "derived" set of a set os the set of its limit points
* theorem: the points of a closing of a set can be partitioned to its limit and isolated points
	* proof is easy: the points [of the closing] either do or do not have other points of the set in all of their neighborhoods
