* "clopen" means (open and closed)
* theorem: the extremal sets are clopen
	* the empty set is open
		* because it is the union of zero open sets
	* the full set is open
		* because it is the intersection of zero open sets
	* hence the full and the empty sets are closed
		* because they are the complements of the empty and full sets, which are open
	* hence both extremal sets are both open and closed
* the "interior" of a set is the union of its open subsets
* theorem: is open = equals to its interior
	\ id oktpeykraqoigtre
	* with other words: the open sets are exactly those which equal to their interior
	* proof is trivial
* the "neighborhood" of a set s is a set which has an open subset which includes s
* the "neighborhood" of a point x is a neighborhood of {x}
* theorem: n is neighborhood of set s <=> n is neighborhood of all points of s
	* =>: trivial
	* <=: use the property that the union of open sets is open
* theorem: s is open <=> s is neighborhood of itself
	* proof is trivial
