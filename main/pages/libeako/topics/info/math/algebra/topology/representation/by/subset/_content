* the "open" "subset" representation
	* S : Set
		* the base set
	* P : Set (S -> Bool)
		* subsets of S
		* this is why i name this representation by "subset", it just specifies a set of subsets of the base set
		* these subsets are said to be the "open" sets in the topology
		* the "closed" sets are the complements of the open sets
	* axioms
		* union of open sets is open
		* intersection of finite number of open sets is open
* the "closed" "subset" representation
	* is the dual of the open one representation, it specifies the closed subsets instead of the open ones
	* the axioms are also inverted
		* union of finite number of closed sets is closed
		* intersection of closed sets is closed
	* the open and closed subset representation are isomorphic
		* proof is trivial
