* proposition
	* if
		* 0 < t < the radius of convergence
		* the 'inner sphere' is the center sphere with radius t
	* then the power series is uniformly convergent on the inner sphere
* proof
	* exists a point b (inside the sphere of convergence) and (outside of the inner sphere)
	* i will show a bound for the norms of the tails of the series that (does not depend on the position in the domain) and (converges to zero)
	* forall part of the series. forall x inside the inner sphere
		* the norm of the sum of the part at x
		* <=
			* because of the triangular inequality of the norm
		* the sum of the norms of the part at x
		* <=
		* the sum of the norms of the part at b
	* hence this latest expression is a valid bound
	* its value does not depend on the position in the domain
		* because it is fixed to b
	* this value converges to zero, because the series is absolutely convergent at b
