* proposition
	* each power series is uniformly convergent on each compact subset of their sphere of convergence
* proof
	* take arbitrary compact subset of the sphere of convergence
	* exists point b (inside the interior of the sphere of convergence) and (outside s)
		* (distance origo) is a continuous function
		* continuous function on compact set has maximum place
		* that maximum-place is inside the interior of the sphere of convergence
		* hence that maximum radius < the radius of convergence
	* i will show a bound for the norms of the tails of the series that (does not depend on the position in the domain) and (converges to zero)
	* forall part of the series. forall x inside the inner sphere
		* the norm of the sum of the parts at x
		* <=
			* because of the triangular inequality of the norm
		* the sum of the norms of the parts at x
		* <=
		* the sum of the norms of the parts at b
	* hence this latest expression is a valid bound
	* its value does not depend on the position in the domain
		* because it is fixed to b
	* this value converges to zero, because the series is absolutely convergent at b
