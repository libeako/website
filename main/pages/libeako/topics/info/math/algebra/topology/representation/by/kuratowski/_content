* the kuratowski "interior" function representation
	* S : Set
	* in : (S -> Bool) -> (S -> Bool)
		* the "interior" function maps to a subset its interior
		* this is why i name this representation by "interior function"
	* axioms
		* intensivity
			* forall x : se x S => se (in x) x
		* idempotence
			* in >>> in = in
		* distributivity of intersection over interior-taking
			* in (intersect {for i in I : xi}) = intersect {for i in I : in xi}
