* the Kuratowski "interior" function representation
	* S : Set
	* in : (S -> Bool) -> (S -> Bool)
		* the "interior" function maps to a subset its interior
		* this is why i name this representation by "interior function"
	* axioms
		* intensivity
			* forall x : se x S => se (in x) x
		* idempotence
			* in >>> in = in
		* distributivity of interior-taking over intersection
			* in (intersect {for i in I : xi}) = intersect {for i in I : in xi}
* the Kuratowski closure function representation
	* analogous to the interior function representation
	* the closure function's name may be "closure" or "close" or "cl"
	* cl = complement >>> in >>> complement
	* all the Kuratowski axioms can be easily phrased with the closure function instead of the interior function
* results
	* in is monotone:

		* statement:
			* forall x y . (x <= y) => (in x <= in y)
		* proof
			* in x
			* =
				* x = intersect {x, y}
					* because x <= y
			* in (intersect {x, y})
			* =
				* by distributivity of in over intersection
			* intersect ({in x, in y})
			* <=
			* in y
