* the kuratowski "interior" function representation
	* S : Set
	* in : (S -> Bool) -> (S -> Bool)
		* the "interior" function maps to a subset its interior
		* this is why i name this representation by "interior function"
	* axioms
		* forall X : se X S => se (in X) (in S)
		* in >>> in = in
		* forall xi [i in 0..n] : in (intersect {xi}) = intersect {(in xi)}
