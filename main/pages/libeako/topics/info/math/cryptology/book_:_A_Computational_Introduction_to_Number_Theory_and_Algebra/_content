* i recommend this book
* it is free [liber]
* i read only a small part of it : introductory number theory, the rsa crypto method, the basic group and ring theory
* the prior knowledge requirement is almost zero; it was a peasant surprise for me that the book managed to explain the mathematical background of the rsa crypto method from scratch and i found the style of the text educational
* i think this book may be a good first course for those who are interested in the [shallow] mathematical background of pre-quantum cryptology
