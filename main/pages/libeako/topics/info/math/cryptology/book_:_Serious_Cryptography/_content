* by Jean-Philippe Aumasson
* this is a very good book; it is second book in cryptology; i usually postpone to write a review about a book till i have finished it, but now i have read only the first third of it, still i start to write a review about it because it is that good; i enjoy it; it does not involve deep math, instead explains the main ideas; it is a good one to learn a key knowledge in crypto from a compact source with very little difficulty
