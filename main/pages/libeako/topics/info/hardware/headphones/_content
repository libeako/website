* do not spend much on headphones
	* the sound and comfort of headphones are very subjective; you probably can find an expensive headphone less satisfying than a 3 timess less expensive one
	* do not spend much time on reading and listening reviews about headphones; you should try them on your own head
	* trying headphones in the street or in a shop is much less reliable than trying them in your home, in lesuire and giving it time
	* you can try many headphones cheaply by buying used ones and reselling them
	* music selection is more important than headphone selection
* "7.1" or "virtual surround" is mostly a scam
