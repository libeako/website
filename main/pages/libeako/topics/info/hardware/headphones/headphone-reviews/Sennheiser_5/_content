* the best this about these headphones is their comfort
	* i only had slight comfort problem with the ones whose headband is of pleather [599], they were slightly rude to my head top
* they are mostly plastic, to save weight, but they are still mostly durable, not many people complain about breakages with these; their stock velour pads also last for long time and the replacement pads are frequently available and cheap
* sound
	* they lack airiness, sibilance, which is mostly an advantage
	* they lack base; the 560S has the strongest technicalities for base but even its base is airy, loose
	* they lack grandness, punch and slam, the sound source feels to be point-like, they sound thin
		* note: this is not a disadvantage, it is just different, depends on listener preference
	* most of them has a problem around 9 KH
		* i can not see this problem in a simple tone sweep but i do hear it in music
		* it is unpleasant and makes the headphone difficult to listen to for long time
		* different Sennheiser 5 types have this problem with different manner and magnitude
		* the 569 may be an exception, i do not remember to hear this problem with it
		* the 560s may be an exception, but even that too has some problem around 9 KH, some harshness, but perhaps a different one
		* this is perhaps the biggest problem of Sennheiser 5 headphones and why i recommend caution in buying them
* overall they are comfy, cheap and durable, with okay sound, but an also comfy, also durable and much better sound is from Superlux 672, if one equalizes it and replaces the useless stock earpads
	* even the 560 is far behind the equalized 672 in sound quality; the 672 is more dynamic, has more micro-detail and is more easy to listen
* concrete types
	* 558
		* thin, slightly metalic, even after equalization
		* contains artificially and intentionally added reverb, as fake sound-stage
	* 559
		* less thin sounding than other Sennheiser 5 headphones
		* dynamic, lively sounding at all frequencies, unlike most of the Sennheiser 5 headphones
		* contains some grain in the 100-1000 region, that is bothering me quite much, it is unpleasant
	* 598
		* comfort is good, like in all Sennheiser 5 types
		* sound
			* very open
			* pleasant sound-stage
			* loose
			* misses dinamysm and impact
			* boring
	* 599
		* is a step back from the 598
			* more base, obviously too much
				* though the measurements tell that they have almost equal amount and frequency response base: i still here more in the 599
			* less open sounding
			* less durable, because the headband pleather coating which tends to peel
			* less elegant looking, because of the stripe on the grill, the 598 does not have that
			* less comfort, because the headband padding's shape is not flat
		* a '599 SE' ["special edition"] also exists, it is black, instead of bone-brown; i had 1 instance of both types, i think the only difference is the color
		* sound
			* more dynamic sounding than most other Sennheiser 5 headphones, including the 560S, but less than the 559
			* with the nomal 599 highs wre sparky or glaring
				* at about 12 - 13 KH; i mean that as a negative; i could not get rid of it with equalization; this was my problem with it and this is why i did not even test it for long, i could not accept that
				* i did not have this problem with the special edition
			* stage is not so good as i would expect from a good open back headphone
	* Game One
		* it has a built-in volume control, which is very elegant, handy and easy to use
		* very comfy
		* sound
			* timbre is realistic
				* lacks any sibilance, in a good way
				* is not metalic
			* macrodetail is good
			* feels very smoothed
				* microdetail is low
				* no punch or slam, no dynamism, music is very slow and boring
					* this always made me to remain unsatisfied and in search for better equalization or other headphone
					* this is an example of headphones which impress me at first but than leave me totally unsatisfied musically
					* this was a big problem of me with this headphone: overly smoothed and boring
				* very laid back
					* perhaps this is what is optimal for gaming, to be able to listen to gun-shots and explosions for long time; but for music i disliked this
				* the highs are 
					* smooth
					* too airy - not in a harsh manner but in a muddy manner
				* compared to the 598
					* they are similarly loose sounding
					* Game One is more realistic and refined
					* the 598 does not have the transient problem that i mentioned for the Game One
			* stock frequency response is quite good, almost 560S level good; it has a 3 db midbase bump, which some users may find annoying, easy to equalize out
			* stage is small
			* separation and layering is low, not even noticable for me; sounds just flow together
			* conclusion: may be good for kids playing, to pretect their hearing from harsh sounds of game but for grown-up people enjoying music: look for something else
		* you may want to read my review about the very similar Sennheiser PC 360 "G4ME"
	* PC 360 "G4ME"
		* this headphone type is very similar to the Sennheiser Game One and the technical connection is very observable
		* the cable of the Game One is detachable, the cable of the PC360 is not
		* comfort - good, overall
			* headband - top confort, same as with Game One
			* earcups
				* the earpads are same as with other Senhheiser 5**s, very good
				* the clamp is stronger than average with Sennheiers 5**s, similar to the 560S, but still comfy
		* sound
			* very similar to the Game One, the technical connection can be heard, has a similar artifical over-smoothness and that same slight annoying and tiring glare at around 9 KH
			* sound dynamic enough, unlike the Game One
			* has some grainness, in the mids or low highs, unlike the Game One, which sounds more refined
	* 569
		* comfort is mostly good but i would have liked the earpads to be bigger slightly
		* difficult to buy replacement earpads in my country, unlike for the open Sennheiser 5 headphones
		* sound
			* has a weirdness near the upper base, which i could not identify and hence could not cease with equalization - this was my big problem with this headphone
			* dull, but acceptable for a closed-back
			* stage is awesome; it is not huge but big enough and [i do not now why] it feels consistent and friendly, cosy; one of the most pleasant stages of all headphones i tried; certainly the best for me among Sennheiser 5 headphones, despite one would expect the opposite, as this is the only closed one among them
	* 560S
		* comfort is good
			* it is similar to other Sennheiser 5 types
			* the headband padding is very soft velour, but regularly causes hot-spot on my head-top
			* the clamp is slightly problematic
				* some people report that the clamp is too strong; but this to me did not cause problem, perhaps because my head is not wide
				* the vertical distribution of the the clamp force is asymmetric; i guess this is by design, to decrease the pressure to the lower parts of our heads because they are softer, more sensitive; but for me the weirdness of this asymmetry is more bothering than more pressure at lower would be; my problem is this asymmetry of the pressure, not the quantity of the pressure
		* sound is good
			* the best advantage is the frequency response balance
			* timbre is soar, wierd, thin; i think this is why many people dislike this headphone
				* no sibilance at all
				* this all makes the macrodetail low, the timbre is not rich
				* the timbre of the Game One is more accurate and more pleaasant
				* the most clear sounding headphone is have heard
					* hence it is good for listening to human speeches
				* the mids are much more tight than with the 598 and 599 or Game One
			* the highs are smooth
			* the highs are sharp
				* not grainy, not sibilance, but "sharp" is the most precise word
					* perhaps at 7100 or 7900 Herz, because by decrease there i managed to decrease the sharpness
				* this is my biggest problem with this headphone
			* base is good technically but still sounds airy, not tight, does not feel like real satisfactory base
			* no punch or slam
			* dynamism is bad: dull, slow, boring
				* feels like the membrane is held back, it can not move freely
				* not so much slow as a Game One, but more than a normal headphone
				* this decreases the microdetail
			* stage
				* depth is big, width is small
			* i suspect that this headphone is an improvement of the 598
				* all are thin sounding, the 560s feels better controlled, more confident, more tight but sharper
