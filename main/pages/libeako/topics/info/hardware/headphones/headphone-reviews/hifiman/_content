* 400SE
	* comfort is not bad, despite the mass
	* sound
		* very sibilant - this is why i could not stand this headphone
		* dynamism: laid back, no punch
* Sundara
	* comfort is good, despite the mass
		* the earcups are a bit small but my (not big) outer ears are inside it and they feel good there
		* the headband is very comfy, it holds this relatively massy headphone without causing hotspot, i barely feel it being on my head
	* sound
		* much better than 400SE
		* sibilant, but much less than 400SE, less even than Sennheiser HD {600, 650, 6xx}; this is the biggest negative of this headphone type
			* hence the timbre is dry
		* dynamism: laid back, no punch
		* not difficult to listen to for long time
		* stage: sounds seem to come from a comfy distance
		* bass feels clean, even when equalized to Harman base shelf, but still not punchy and does not oppress the mids 
	* Superlux 672 is much better, even though it is 10 * cheaper
	* durability
		* the metal ratchet area of the arms of the headband get scratched very easily, on my instance it took only 4-6 changes
