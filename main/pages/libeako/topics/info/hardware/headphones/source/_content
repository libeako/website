* stored sound data resolution
	* i can hear the difference between Youtube resolution [about 130 Kb/s] and max mp3 resolution [320 Kb/s]; i do not hear difference above that; mos of the times the sound hardware will be more important than data resolution
* DAC+amp
	* the stored sound data must get converted from discrete to analog representation and get amplified
		* "DAC" is short form for "discrete to analog conversion"
			* most people say "digital" intstead of "discrete", because they think that "discrete" is discrete only in the time domain and not in the amplitude domain, which i think is false; hence i think "discrete" is the correct word here; most people would disagree with me
		* "amp" is short form of "amplifier"
	* DACs and amps are usually bundled together into a common product but sometimes [rather with the more expensive ones] they are distributed separately
	* most personal computers contain a DAC+amp
		* it is either integrated into the motherboard or is a discrete card
		* the inside of the computer contains some electromagnetic noise; this may flow into the DAC+amp; this is a big reason why many people want an external DAC+amp
			* for example the integrated DAC+amp in my cheap motherboard outputs slight hiss-like noise; slight enough that non-trained people would not notice it
	* how much do amps matter?
		* more than the stored sound data resolution
		* less than the headphone
	* how much do DACs matter? less than even the amplifiers
		* what matters in DACs is probably not the DAC itself but the  amplifier built into them; yes, DACs themselves may contain a small amplifier, which amplifies the analog output of the DAC to the line level

* cables
	* cables do not matter
		* electromagnetic noise almost never cause audible amount of distortion in sound; the biggest source of electromagnetic noise around a headphone cabling is probably the computer but even its noise is too weak to matter
		* impedance of the cables also do not matter; it is true for almost all headphone types that the additional impedance of the cable does not change the sound quality significantly either positively or negatively
