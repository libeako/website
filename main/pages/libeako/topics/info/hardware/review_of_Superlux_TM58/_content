* this is similar to the legendary Shur SM58, but 3-4 times cheaper
* the voice style is good : natural, clear, detailed
* the bad is the handling noise being high and the sensitivity being low
* sensitivity
	* i use a Behringer UMC22 amplifier; which i think is quite a good one; but still its noise creeps into the recording because i have to set the gain to 85-90%; to avoid this noise i have to maximize the (signal / noise) value by putting the microphone almost into my mouth and speaking into it from the very front of it; this of course aplifies the wind noises and mouth noises but i found that the microphone is good in resisting those, even with this close usage it is not worth than my Sandberg USB Mic Kit was with a condenser microphone from further
* handling noise
	* it is so laud that even if i am not tapping on it, just holding it still in my hand - the noise generated is visible in the waveform compared to having the microphone lie still on a pile of clothes on the desk
* wind noise
	* very good; the situation is good even without additional wind filtering; but i put on it a very cheap foam cap; that significantly reduces the winds and is surely worth to get and use it in my opinion; with it the plosives are very silent; the biggest problem for me was the breezing wind, but even that is quite good
* my recommendation : use a foam cap windscreen, speak into it from very close and from the very front and do not hand-hold
