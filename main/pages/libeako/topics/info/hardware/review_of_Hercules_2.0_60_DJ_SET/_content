* sound
	* overall okay
	* almost all headphones have better or at least similarly good sound
	* can not go lower than 60 herz, where it starts to strugles
* sound signal output
	* the set has an sound signal output port, but it is hearably worse than the direct output from the computer
* reliability
	* after several years of usage and then 1 year of idle status: the left piece started to give noise, the level of which was independent of the signal strength
