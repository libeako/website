* one of the many if not the most legendary audiophile headphone
* the skeleton seems to be strong, gives confidence
	* more than with the Sennheiser 5 types
	* they seem to last forever
* comfort is good
	* mass is low
	* advantage over Sennheiser 5 types is that those contain a small bumb in the inside of the cups
	* the headband padding is not so comfy as with the cheaper Sennheiser 5** headphones, i did feel hotspot on my head.
* overall
	* they have good midrange
	* good headphone but not great, not up to its fame
		* performed badly on Behringer UMC22 and Fiio E10K
		* performed wonderfully on Topping L30
* concrete types
	* 580 Precision
		* this is the first type of this type-family
		* has magical mid-range, more than 6xx
		* less sibilant than 6xx
		* i was surprised by how much i do not care about environmental noises when listening to this headphone, which may be a good sign
	* 600
		* my first surprise was that the sound is somewhat soar, but this feeling disappeared later
		* stage is said to be very small; i was afraid of this but it does not bother me, it is even pleasant; the stage of the 650 did bother me
		* frequency response: very neutral
		* timbre is too dry, a texture added by the headphone
			* like if i was listening to loud-speakers
		* dynamism is too low - makes the sound feel flat
		* separation is good
		* easy to listen to for long time
		* the sound for me is too muddy, surpy
	* 650, 6xx
		* sounds similar to hd 600, unsurprisingly
		* it is laid back, but less so than Sennheiser 598 and Game One are
		* has some punch, unlike the Sennheiser 5 types, but this punch is not a pleasant one for me
		* has some real base, more than the Sennheiser 5 types
		* stage is even across the space dimensions but it is zero
		* has some old style, as if i went back into the 80s, similar to the sound of cheap Koss headphones
	* 660 S2
		* sound
			* very similar to the old ones
			* less mid-focused
			* stage is not big, but round and okay, does not feel so closed as a 6xx
			* very netural sounding
			* boring?
			* when i switch to may Superlux 672: i feel like breezing again, i hear more detail
		* everything else is the same
