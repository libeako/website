* 400SE
	* comfort
		* headband is deeply padded but still not good enough because of the weight; i regularly get skin ache at the top of my head by its pressure
	* sound: bad because sibilance
		* very sibilant - this is why i could not stand this headphone
		* lacks slam, punch
* Sundara
	* comfort is good, despite the mass
		* the earcups are a bit small but my (not big) outer ears are inside it and they feel good there
		* the headband is very comfy, it holds this relatively massy headphone without causing hotspot, i barely feel it being on my head
	* sound
		* much better than 400SE
		* sibilant, but much less than 400SE, less even than Sennheiser HD {600, 650, 6xx}; this is the biggest negative of this headphone type
			* hence the timbre is dry
		* dynamism: laid back, no punch
		* not difficult to listen to for long time
		* stage: sounds seem to come from a comfy distance
		* bass feels clean, even when equalized to Harman base shelf, but still not punchy and does not oppress the mids 
		* the waveform of the sound is naturally flat, this is pleasant and calming
		* renders mids and base with leisure
	* Superlux 672 is much better, even though it is 10 * cheaper
	* durability
		* the metal ratchet area of the arms of the headband get scratched very easily, on my instance it took only 4-6 changes
* Edition XS
	* comfort
		* earpads are very comfy
		* headband is bad
			* makes hotspot
				* like a Sennheiser HD6x0
			* slides forward when head is not upright
				* though this has the good property that makes us remember to maintain good posture
		* sound
			* not bad, not good
			* somewhat shouty and grainy
			* stage
				* airy
				* big
				* not pleasant
					* lacks intimacy and coherence
					* the AKG K371 has more pleasant stage
			* highs are not nice, somewhat woody but still not detailed, lacks smoothness
			* bass
				* without equalization barely audible
				* with equalization still not full and enjoyable for me
