* here i am speaking about the Beyerdynamic DT { 770 | 880 | 990 } headphone types and their relatives
* comfort is mostly good but the headbend padding of the 990 and 880 is too rude for me, it developes hot spots on my head top over time
* sound
	* dynamism is high and realistic
	* the highs
		* many people complain about the highs being elevated; yes, it is elevated, but smooth, even in the 990
		* the timbre in the high frequencies is too airy or sibilant; it is not too harsh to tolerate but does hurt the easiness to listen, the timbre and the resolution
* DT 770 80 ohm
	* the biggest sound-stage i have ever hear with a closed-back headphone
	* stock frequency response is listenable for me
		* even though the mid-base has a dip: this base is more clean for me without equalization than the base of the 990 or TYGR with equalization
	* very dry sound
* DT 770 250 ohm
	* sound stage is surprisingly big from closed headphone
	* dynamism is one of the best and highest can get up to $300
	* sound is too dry, but less so than with the 80 ohm version
* DT 990 250 ohm
	* i sold this headphone very quickly with rage; my reason was the 80-400 Herz region where i heard something weird that i could not get rid of with equalization
	* the highs feel detached from the lower frequency ranges
* DT 880 32 ohm
	* sound
		* timbre: dry, sibilant, even after equalization
		* feels quite neutral, with and without equalization
* DT 880 250 ohm
	* comfort
		* of the headband is not good enough, it develops hotspot on my sensitive headtop in minutes
		* of the earpads is okay or good
	* sound
		* sibilant
			* not so much as the lower impedance versions but still
			* this is a big problem for me
		* stage is very pleasant
		* midrange is exceptionally good for this price, it is precise, quick, leasure
		* good dynamics
* TYGR 300 R
	* very similar to the 990
	* it contains an acoustic filter, to decrease the highs; it does it; it seems that it does not hurt the resolution of the headphone
		* it consumes some space, hence the outer ears may more easily touch it when the earpads get more shallow by wearing; some people could be annoyed by this; i bought my instance from a person who sold it because of this; i though was not much bothered by the problem
	* the headband comfort is better than with the 990 because its padding is more soft, but still makes hotspot
	* sound
		* dynamic, but for me some of this dynamics feels to be fake
		* V-shapedness is easily audible at first listen
			* still somehow gives kind of natural and consistent sound frequency response perception, it feels okay; can be listened even without equalization; a non-trained listener would probably not notice the V-shapedness or be not bothered by it
			* gives immersion
			* increases the stage size
		* my main problem with the sound is the same that i had with the DT 990: the upper base contains something weird, that i can not get rid of with equalization; when i equalize it down then the sound becomes weird [very dry and woody]
		* i percieve the sound as if the headphone was closed; even some closed headphones, like the 770 or the HyperX Cloud Alpha is more open sounding; this bothers me quite much because i like open sound
		* classical music sounds so good that i wonder if it was designed for classical
		* the stage is big and more importantly is pleasant
	* comparison to Philips X2HR
		* the X2 has a wider headband, which hence is more comfy
		* sound
			* the X2 has more body for the sound, some densness in the mids; the TYGR is rather thin [though not point-source-like]
			* the X2 is moore smooth in the highs
			* the X2 has much less dynamism and clarity
			* the stage of the TYGR is more pleasant [natural], though the X2 is also good in stage
* DT 900
	* sound
		* new sound-maker: "Stellar.45"
			* much cleaner at high frequency than the old variant
		* has some wierd 70KHz-ish sound that i can not totally get rid of with EQ; this is my big problem with it
		* base is much better than HD6x0
			* more confident and clean
		* mids are leasure and easy to listen, but not surpy
		* separation is high
		* microdetail is plenty
			* despite the rumor of the opposite
			* much more than in the loved for detail HD 6x0 types
		* that playful dynamics of Beyer 45 mm sound-maker
		* sounds enjoyable at low volume and i want the volume to be low
	* headband is somewhat more comfy
