* here i speak about the Superlux headphone types that are open and the transducers of them are 50 mm
* sound
	* dynamics is good but not too much at all, more than Sennheiser 560 S, less than Beyer TYGR 300R
	* stage
		* dimension x
			* it is not limited at all while it is still intimate; to have this both at the same time is rare and very awesome; this is one big strength of these headphones; i feel that i am in an ocean of sounds, i float on it with comfort, this ocean does not have any limit, but it still is touching me directly, surrounds me
		* dimension y is small
		* dimension z is okay
		* roundness
			* dimension y being small and dimesnion x being big makes the stage to feel not round enough - unpleasant
	* they feel as if the waveform would be planar instead of spherical
	* separation and layering are incredibly good for the price
		* not only the separation by itself is very good, but how the separated streams still feel in concert
	* resolution is good
	* musical; i define this term so that i easily understand the intent of the musical artist; it is with these headphones that i hear melodies from the music and they stay in my mind, i sing them in myself later on
	* compared to
		* Fidelio X2, X3
			* the Superluxes are much more playful, dinamic, are a bit more shouty, have much more separation, have bigger space
* 681
	* the earpads are bad; they are small, rude and can get weared off quickly; they must be replaced
	* the headbend is a bit rude, it does not accommodate in shape to the shape of the head top surface
	* sound is sibilant quite much, which i could not get rid of with equalization; this is my biggest problem with this headphone type
* 681 Evo
	* the earpads are bigger than the ones of the 681; hence they are more comfy
	* headband is bad because it is equipped with torturing devices on its lower side; these are bumps that decrease the contact area, hence increase the pressure
	* the strengthening of the connection of the cable and the headphone cup is not strengthened at all, hence that is a point where it often breaks; quite some people complain about that on the web and that problem broke my instance too
	* sound
		* similar to the 681
		* the sibilance is still present but in a different way; its feels as if it is happening more often but with less amplitude - this is the biggest problem of this headphone
		* without equalization
			* usable, but the base is too strong with the pleather pads; with the velour pads too, but then it is acceptable; it is also shouty, because of elevation around 2 KH
		* base is nice with this headphone, it is tight, warm, smooth
* 672
	* the stock earpads are useless; they are unacceptably uncomfy and they also hurt the sound; you need to have a plan to replace the pads before deciding to buy this headphone
		* one way to do it is to buy a 681 Evo, which comes with 2 pairs of earpads, leave it with the velour pads, take out from it the pleather pads and put them on the 672 - they fit perfectly; the velour pads of the 681 Evo do not fit to the 672 [perhaps surprisingly]
	* this headphone is incredibly good for its price, even when the additionally to buy alternative earpads cost is counted too
	* comfort
		* with the stock earpads: bad, almost impossible to use
		* with a good earpad: good, because it is very light
		* the standard Beyerdynamic DT XX0 earpads fit nicely
	* sound
		* all the positives of the older 50 mm open Superluxes [681, 681 Evo, ...]; these positives are great; they are so great that some audiophiles accept the negatives, the sibilance and harsh glaring of these headphones
		* what makes the 672 incredibly good is that it has the positives but not the sibilance of its predecessors; the amount of glare and sibilance in the 672 is small; it is not even metalic, like for example the 560S is; the highs are smooth too; easy to listen to
		* its cleanness increases the resolution; which is not less than of Beyerdynamic DT 880 32 ohm, Beyerdynamic TYGR 300 R, Sennheiser 560S, Hifiman HE400se
		* stock frequency response
			* acceptable, but still contains 1 - 2 sharp jumps in the highs; in my listening these are not so bad as they look in a graph; perhaps because the highs are otherwise smooth and clean
			* i managed to get equalize a frequency response for myself that i am satisfied with
		* timbre
			* the timbre is plasticky, rubbery, depending on equalization; it is not unpleasant though, quite the opposite
			* female vocals and piano sound exceptionally clean, realistic and pleasant
			* even despite the plastickiness: the timbre is better than with Beyerdynamic DT 880 32 ohm, Beyerdynamic TYGR 300 R, Sennheiser HE400se; competes with HD 560S in timbre and HD 600
		* it is crazy how much more musical this headphone is compared to others; while with others [Sennheiser Game One, Beyer TYGR 300R] I hear a set of noises: with this Superlux i hear melodies and intentions of the artist, instruments that are separated, yet each sing their share of the same sone, their part of the same story, in concerto; i listen to a song with those mentioned other headphones and i do not like the song but i have learned that perhaps i will like the song with a Superlux, so i do not trust the headphone, i change to the Superlux and i understand what that song is about
	* comparison
		* with my new earpads and my equalization this headphone is better than all Sennheiser 5__ headphones, including the 560S and the Beyer TYGR 300R; the sound quality is one tier above those
		* this is better headphone than the DT 1990
			* the 1990 headband is uncomfy, partially because of the weight
			* the 1990 has a texture in the sound that i could not equalize out
			* the 1990 sound is more closed
		* this is better headphonethan Hifiman Sundara.
			* the Sundara is sibilant and is not more detailed and is less dynamic
		* this is better headphone than the HD 600
			* the 600 headband is less comfy
			* the 600 has a texture in the highs that i do not even have idea how to equalize out
			* the 600 sound feels slow and closed
		* this is better headphone than the ATH R70x
			* the R70 is less durable, because the wing suspension
			* the R70 is uncomfy because the earpad diameter is too small
			* the R70 is slightly sibilant
