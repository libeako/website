* FT1
	* comfy enough, despite having not small amount of mass
	* closed dynamic
		* sound
			* musical
			* correct mid-range
			* sibilant, but barable
			* the closed nature does not harm it much, the closing back of the headphone is not hearable much
			* micro-detail would be good, but is harmed by the sibilance
			* spatial properties are good and are fantastic for a closed headphone
			* isolation is not much
			* timbre would be fantastic, but with the sibilance it is only okay or good
	* Pro - open planar magnetic
		* sound
			* not musical
			* stage is small, the sounds feel compressed
			* separation is good
			* the timbre is super clean; the cleanest headphone i have ever heard
				* hence it is very easy to listen to
				* timbre
					* rich
					* plasticcy, it smoothes out every piece of dirt, both from itself and from the music
						* even bad recordings sound okay with it
			* micro-detail is high, thanks to cleanliness, even with its smooth nature
			* overall a very detailed headphone
			* more dynamic then an average planar but still not so much as an average electro-dynamic
			* because of these properties: the sound is recommendable for professional usage, where it is not enjoyment that is sought but easyness-to-listen and detail
