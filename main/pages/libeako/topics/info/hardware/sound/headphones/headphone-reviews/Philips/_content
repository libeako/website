* Fidelio X2, X3
	* sound
		* stage is good
		* waveform is pleasantly flat
		* mids are smooth, not shouty, still fast enough
		* sound has body, meat, too much, i miss clarity
		* similar to Sennheiser HD 650
			* with its protecting nature
			* but without that big surpiness
				* still more shouty; the HD 6x0 mids are more smooth and gentle
		* separation feels better than Sennhesier HD6x0
	* X2
		* sound
			* too much base, i miss clarity
			* highs are smooth and clean
				* more than Sennheiser HD 660S2
				* unlike with X3, which is sibilant, even with equalization
			* easy to listen to for long time, not offensive anywhere, tries to protect my ears above all, this is the perfect attitude, it feels immediately that it is designed to be good instead of to impress
			* i miss sepearation of sound, sounds kind of flow together too much
				* but this does not kill the experience, it is tolerable, it fits into the overall style of the sound
		* comparison to TYGR 300 R
			* the X2
				* is more comfy
					* the headband has more contact
				* iss less durable
					* the suspension is rubber-based
				* has better sound
					* the highs are smoother
					* the lows and mids are more meaty, substential
	* X3
		* comfort
			* earpads are comfy
			* headband is not comfy enough
				* it makes a hotspot
					* like Sennheiser 6x* headphones
		* wire is very microphony [why Philips, why?]
		* sound compared to X2
			* adds the missed clarity
			* the overall frequency response is very grown-up sounding
				* feels very refined, high end, with its everywhere gentle nature and clarity
			* elevated at 10-13 KHz, which degrades the sound quality by much, but still barable
			* highs still miss sparkle, despite the elevation
			* is sibilant, even with EQ
				* this is the biggest problem
			* sterile, non-exciting, like a Hifiman planar magnetic
				* what a DT 880 wanted to be, but without the harsh and dynamic character of that
