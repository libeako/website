* do not spend much on headphones
	* the sound and comfort of headphones are very subjective; you probably can find an expensive headphone less satisfying than a 3 timess less expensive one
	* do not spend much time on reading and listening reviews about headphones; you should try them on your own head
	* trying headphones in the street or in a shop is much less reliable than trying them in your home, in lesuire and giving it time
	* you can try many headphones cheaply by buying used ones and reselling them
	* music selection is more important than headphone selection

* cables do not matter in my opinion
	* electromagnetic noise almost never cause audible amount of distortion in sound; the biggest source of electromagnetic noise around a headphone cabling is probably the computer but even its noise is too weak to matter
	* impedance of the cables also do not matter; it is true for almost all headphone types that the additional impedance of the cable does not change the sound quality significantly either positively or negatively
	* the inductivity and capacity of a headphone cable is too small to cause audible difference
