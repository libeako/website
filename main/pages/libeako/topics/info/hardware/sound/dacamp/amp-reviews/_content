* Behringer UMC22 U-Phoria
	* this is a cheap but quality "audio interface"
	* it contains both an input and an output DAC+amp
	* thus it can function as a headphone amplifier too, as such it is neutral sounding but somewhat metalic, but it still is not difficult to listen to for long time
* FiiO E10K Olympus 2
	* cheap, small headphone amplifier
	* sound
		* clean, somewhat smoothed; no harshness, no sibilance, no metalic timbre
			* this makes it easy to listen to for long time
		* as if it was elevated at around 160 Herz
		* stage is smaller than with Behringer UMC22
* Beyerdynamic A 20
	* neutral, non-offensive, never harsh, maybe a little more tightness would be better
	* could drive my Sennheiser Game One with acceptable sound quality; this is notable because that headphone usually sounds unpleasantly wet
* Topping L30
	* is warm all the time, even on smallest gain, even when no sound is played
	* sound
		* lean
		* thin, but still wet
		* my Sennheiser 6xx sounded awesome on it
		* my Superlux 672 did not show a big quality improvement by switching from cheap Behringer UMC22 to this amp
