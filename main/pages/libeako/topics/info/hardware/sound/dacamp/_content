* the stored sound data must get converted from discrete to analog representation and get amplified
	* "DAC" is short form of "discrete to analog conversion"
		* most people say "digital" intstead of "discrete", because they think that "discrete" is discrete only in the time domain and not in the amplitude domain, which i think is false; hence i think "discrete" is the correct word here; most people would disagree with me
	* "amp" is short form of "amplifier"
* DACs and amps are often bundled together into a common product but sometimes [rather with the more expensive ones] they are distributed separately
* most personal computers contain a DAC+amp
	* it is either integrated into the motherboard or is a discrete card
	* the inside of the computer contains some electromagnetic noise; this may flow into the DAC+amp; this is a big reason why many people want an external DAC+amp
		* for example the integrated DAC+amp in my cheap motherboard outputs slight hiss-like noise; slight enough that non-trained people would not notice it
* amps matter less than headphones
* DACs matter less than amps
	* what matters in DACs is probably not the DAC itself but the  amplifier built into them; yes, DACs themselves may contain a small amplifier, which amplifies the analog output of the DAC to the line level

* my experience
	* i had these amplifiers till now:
		* RealtekÂ® ALC887
			* this is integrated onto my cheap motherboard
		* Behringer UMC 22
			* this is an "audio interface, mainly for input amplificaation, the headphone output amplification is only an addition for direct monitoring of the input, not intended for high quality music enjoyment
		* FiiO E10K Olympus 2
			* this is my 1st and only dedicated amp for music enjoyment
