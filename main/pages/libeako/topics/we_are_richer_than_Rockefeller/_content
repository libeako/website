* allegedly John Rockefeller [1839 - 1937] was the richest human since 1900 [by the way : self made]; his wealth was about 340 dollars with the dollar's current value; that is about 3 richer than the current richest human
* still : a human in Europe working there for half the median wage is richer than John was :
	* has much better health care and more expected life time
	* has much better opportunities to travel around, meet interesting people, find the love of its life
	* has much better opportunity to keep in touch with loved ones, via the internet
	* has much better ways of learning, thinking, entertainment
