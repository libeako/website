* my advise for [young] people is to not spend your time in college
* institutional learning is very inefficient
	* many people say that it is not wasteful to spend time in college, even that they did learn a few things in it; but that is not enough; to learn some things is much too little; you should spend your time efficiently and the efficiency of college is many times lower than that of self learning from the internet or from colleagues at work
	* in college one learns to pass exams and not to get knowledge which is useful in real life; and a big difference is between the 2; in self learning one sucks the knowledge into itself, in institution one pushes it into itself with stress
	* in institutions the learning plan is fixed, broad, usually outdated
* if you are dreaming to become a healer, lawyer, architect, ... then you probably must get a state certificate in order the state to allow you to practice those professions, but with other professions [IT, math, physics, trading, business management, ...] i advise you to skip college; for free to practice professions it is a stressful waste of precious young time, and the certificate that you get with it proves only that you was stupid enough to do it
