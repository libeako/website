* cars are over-featured, over-complicated, genuine passion is absent from the designs
* usual incorrectnesses in talking
	* 'transmission' -> 'leverage' ('selector' or 'changer')
	* 'revs' -> 'frequency'
	* '6-speed transmission' -> '6 degree ...'
		* those are not speeds, they are degrees
	* 'torq' -> 'power'
		* torq of the engine does not matter
		* torq at the wheels matter more, but that can be arbitrarily big, just be including a very small leveraga [for example: gear] by the car designer engineers
		* even torq at the wheels does not matter practically, because it matters only in whether the car can move upward; but in almost all practical sitatutions that is trivially easy for any car
		* i guess that people say 'torq' when they mean power at low engine frequency and they are just too stupid to understand that they are talking incorrectly; power and torq are different physical quantites and of the 2: it is the power that determines acceleration, never torq
		* acceleration is gaining speed
			* that is converting energy from chemical or electric to kinetic; the magnitude of the acceleration is the speed of this conversion; the conversion is doing work by the engine; the speed of doing work is 'power'
