* among automobile users it is widely spread feeling and habbit that the engine torque is a useful information; 
* nope, it is not
* the power of the engine totally determines the acceleration of the vehicle, no need for the torque information
* the torque information is not useful for anything else either; the torque of the engine does not matter; the force on the vehicle could matter theoretically, but that is independent from the engine torque, because of the transmission ratio and the wheel size varies and especially the transmission ratio can be designed to achieve any useful force on the vehicle with any engine torque
