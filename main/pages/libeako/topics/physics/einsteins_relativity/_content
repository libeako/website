* einstein's relativity is a mind-blending; i started to learn it because i wanted to learn quantum physics and quickly recognized that some basic knowledge of einstein's relativity is desirable for that; the opposite is false, that is: quantum physics is not necessary for relativity; hence it is good to learn relativity before quantum physics
* special
	* Special Relativity with Brian Greene 
		* this is the best educational material that i have seen till now
		* he does not require knowledge of physics or math, still manages to make the student understand the basic concepts, in very short time
		* he is a real theoretical physicist, he does not blur the concepts, he is accurate
		* short version, without math
			* watch at least this one, its (usefulness / time) value is very high
			* on youtube

		* long version, with math
			* the math in this is still easy [though a few hours long] and arrives at E=mc^2
			* on youtube

	* Theory of Special Relativity by Nadia L. Zakamska
		* this book is very compact, but understandable
		* link

	* speed of light
		* the Fizeau measurement
			* this is a very clever trick to measure the speed of light relatively cheaply down here on earth
			* youtube video explaining

		* the speed of light may be not isotropic

* general
	* the math of general relativity is more difficult than the math of special relativity
