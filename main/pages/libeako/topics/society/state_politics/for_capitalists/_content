* capitalists like the state too

* the state spending does not cause the money to lose value
	* the money spent by the state exists already before the state spends it; separate in your thinking state spending and money creation by the state - they are very different activities by the state
* party
	* capitalist parties are good tools in my opinion; they attract attention, which capitalism needs
	* the proper goal of a capitalist party is education,
		* the education
			* more precisely: to motavate people to think
				* this is very difficult because it requires us to not tell everything, we need themselves to think, only their own thinking produces deep understanging of capitalism; but if we do not tell everything then they will not understand us; yes, this is a big difficulty in our goal
			* the more capitalist a human is - the more important to make him a capitalist
				* the cost of it is much less
				* the result of it is much more honest and deep and durable
		* gaining popularity and state power is good result but bad goal
	* capitalist parties can be any pupolular, just like parties of other political directions
		* though the party may need to be moderate enough for that; extreme politicians rarely gain the sympathy of large part of the voters
	* the biggest obstacle for capitalist parties are the capitalist politicians themselves
		* many of them do not want to be official politicians, they do not want to be inside the state, not even to decrease it 
			* they like to complain about how bad the elected lords are but they themselves do not want to be elected; well: if only bad people run for office then the elected ones will be bad surely
		* capitalist people are very principled, they easily confront, even with their own, cracks through a capitalist party can easily occur; capitalist people often are not ready for compromise, they often chase perfection
