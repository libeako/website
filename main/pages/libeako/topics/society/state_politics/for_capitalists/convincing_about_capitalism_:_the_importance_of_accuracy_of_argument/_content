* generally capitalism is unpopular, and difficult to convince people about; hence the convincing person should care much about the accuracy of its argument; by accuracy here i mean both the selection of individual words and the validity of the logic in the deduction; if the argument is incorrect then it is difficult for the subject person to understand or even the subject person may conclude that the convincer has invalid logic or false factual knowledge; thus inaccurate argument harms the goal of capitalist teaching, is worse then no argument
