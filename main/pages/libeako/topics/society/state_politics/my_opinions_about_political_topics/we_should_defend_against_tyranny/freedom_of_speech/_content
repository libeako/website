* tyranny is the biggest danger of humanity and  freedom of speech is the most important, totally peaceful and cheap defense against it; hence it should be guarded by constitution strongly
* foundation with XYZ
	* X talks to Y; according to Z : X's talk is false, hence it is harmful, hence X wants to obstruct it; what methods do Z have? the obvious method : Z can contact Y, telling its problems about X's talk, then Y decides if it continues to listen to X or changes it opinion about X according to the warning of Z; this method is widely accepted; as it is peaceful; but Z may find this method too weak; Z may want to avoid the technical cost of talking to Y or rather : Z may be afraid of not being able to convine Y to not listen to X; the big question : then may Z apply harsher method? may Z beat or threaten X to force X to stop talking? should the society allow this fox Z? with other wording : should Z be allowed to aggressively silence X?
	* no
	* because :
		* it is not certain that Z is right; not even if Z is very certain; if Z does not succeed in convincing then X and Y may have good reason to stay with their earlier opinion; the necessity of convincing is a safety feature preventing false opinions to spread and unfair treatment against X
		* Z's motivation to stop the talk of X may be selfish, perhaps X's talk hurts Z's personal interest; hence Z's claim that X's talk is false may be malicious lie, pretense to attack X
	* what is Z represents the majority of the people? [perhaps is a democratic state]
		* still no, very much not; aggressive silencing is especially applied by tyrannies; this alone is very good reason to deny aggressive silencing
	* what if Z is the majority of the people? perhaps voting directly for a certain aggressive silencing?
		* still no; if the majority of people thinks something then that fact alone is strongly convincing
* the 2 methods to resolve conflicts in society
	* peaceful discussion
		* this brings people closer to each other, lets one teach the other
	* aggression [or theft]
		* this creates possibility to unfairly oppress, poisons the relationships between the people, creates enemies; perhaps latently, but always
* freedom already proved
	* for a decade the majority of the internet was totally free; and this did not cause big harm; we can think about this time interval as an experiment, and that it proved that freedom, even total communication freedom [with strong encryption, anonymity] works well and without big harm
* generally the state is wrong defense against wrong speech
