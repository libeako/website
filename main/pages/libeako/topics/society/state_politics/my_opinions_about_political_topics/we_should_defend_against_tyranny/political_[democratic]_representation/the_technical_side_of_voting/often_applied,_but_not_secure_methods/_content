* cyber
	* in the traditional (paper ballot - urn) method the ballots are observable physically; an ordinary human can observe an urn, count ballots, interpret the votes, without special equipment or competence
	* but computers work as black boxes for humans; humans can not verify the internal operation of computers
	* usual stupid arguments about the security of internet voting
		* "the "Lithuanian model" has been working for many years and their is not complaint against its operation"
			* not only in Lithuania; but : the lack of complaints is not because the system is secure, but because they do not care
		* "we can securely bank online, hence we can securely vote online"
			* we can fly with aricaft safely, we still can not submerge in the sea with aircaft safely
			* the security of internet banking is only the security of the communication channel between the bank and its client
	* never, nowhere was a secure cyber voting held; instead the security of cyber voting is only in the speeches of the politicians and in the stupid brains of the ordinary people, but with full confidence there
	* why is it difficult to design a cyber voting system ?
		* try and you will see; spend the effort : invent a secure system, only a theoretical one; i bet you have never ever even thought about it; instead you readily believed without doubt and even spread the lie that the cyber voting systems are secure; after all : what you gave up by this is only the democracy; now try and invent a secure cyber system, try at least for some minutes
		* i guess you do not understand, not even what is the task [meanwhile perhaps you are very sure that it is already solved]; i help you by repeating some of the requirement for a secure voting system [though you should know them on your own]
			* the state [the operator of the election system] must be able to aggregate the votes; the state must not know the individual votes; the state must be able to prove to voter x that x's vote was taken into account correctly; the voter must not be able to prove its vote
			* what is difficult in this ?
				* the state must not know the votes, but still has to take them into account and even to prove to the voter what the voter voted for, and the voter must not be able to forward the proof to other person
* by paper mail
	* the voter can prove its vote by preparing and sending it in front of the person to whom the voter want to prove its vote
	* the vote may be compromised in the mail service
	* if the originality of the signatures is not verified [mostly this is the case because of the difficulty of verifying hand writing signatures] then it is possible to vote in someone else's name; all is needed is to know about someone that that person itself is not going to vote
	* if the voter is an inhabitant of an other country then even the fact (that the voter is still alive) can not be verified
