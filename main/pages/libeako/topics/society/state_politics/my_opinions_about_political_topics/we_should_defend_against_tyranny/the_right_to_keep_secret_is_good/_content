* having secret against the state must be a right; it is important for democracy
* serious criminals relatively easily hide the existence of their secrets, and they are not afraid of the prohibition of keeping secret, because they are in the process of committing more serious crime anyway; hence prohibiting having secret against the state affects only small criminals and mostly law abiding citizens, being very harmful and dangerous in the latter case
* witnesses, suspects and everyone should have the right ti be silent, that is to not answer to questions from police, prosecution and other authorities
* telling password must not be forced
	* beside violating the right to have secret : forgetting passwords is very frequent, hence even people otherwise intending to cooperate with the state could get to jail innocently, it is enough to just launch an extensive investigation, for perhaps fake reason, involving all its computer devices or online accounts
