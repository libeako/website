* here the word "candidate" may mean not only individual, but also a political party, for simplicity
* the nature of condidate constraint
	* unnecessary
		* in an election the greatest majosty itselft, the people have opportunity to reject candidates, by not voting for them
	* illegitimate
		* a constraint is created by lawmakers, who got democratic legitimacy to create laws; but this is only for the intermediate time between elections; but this does not cover the power to constrain the people's choice at next elections
	* dangerous
		* legislating out candidates from the election [or at least making their situation more difficult] is a tool of tyranny
* therefore the constitution should deny the constraining of the candidates
* every voter should be entitled with the right of being represented in the parliament, even those with weird political views, that are hated by the majority
* the candidates should not be constrained for these reasons either :
	* the past of the candidate
		* examples :
			* maintained a tyranny
			* criminal record
	* has horrible plans
		* examples :
			* wants to demolish democracy
			* wants to create death camps, to exterminate the majority of the population
	* the majority does not like their composition, or the internal code of the composition
		* example : they exclude women, ...
	* they keep secret the identities of their [financial] supporters or the amount of support
	* does not have graduation
