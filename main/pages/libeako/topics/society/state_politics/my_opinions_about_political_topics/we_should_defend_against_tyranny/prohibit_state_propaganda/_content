* because :
	* it is wealth corruption, as by it the government parties spend state money on their own political propaganda
	* it introduces bias to among the political players media background, as the political opposition have significantly less access to the state propaganda
		* by this it is a tyrannical act
* let us deny for the state to
	* own, operate media
	* advertise
		* because the elite parties can abuse it; they can :
			* steel state money for the friendly media by overpriced advertising
			* advertise their own political agenda by this
				* examples from Hungary [from Viktor Orban's regime] [if you find these ridiculous then the fault is not in you] : 
					* the Hungarian reforms work
						* Hungary performs better
						* Hungary is getting stronger
						* we have bigger economical growth than the EU
						* more money to create jobs
						* minimal wage rises again
						* the personal income tax decreases
						* the family tax advantage gows
						* the new family tax advantage is big help
						* 3 million forint for home creation
						* home creation : +10 million forint
						* kindergarten for children will be free
						* the price of electricity, gas, remote heating decreases by 20% this year
					* if you come into Hungary then
						* you must abide to our laws
						* you must not take the jobs of Hungarians
						* you must respect our culture
					* about immigration
						* from the start of the immigration crisis more than 300 people died in terror attacks
						* the Paris attack was committed by immigrants
						* 1.5 million immigrants arrived into Europe in the previous year
						* from the start of the immigration crisis the number of attacks against women grew substantially
						* almost 1 million immigrants want to come into Europe only from Libya
						* let us not risk! vote "no"!
						* Brussels wants to settle a town-ful of immigrants into Hungary
						* let us stop Brussels
						* let us send a message to Brussels so that they undersand too
						* we messaged to Brussels : 99% no for forced immigrant settlement
						* people decided; the country must be defended
						* let us not allow it to be Soros who loughs at the end
					* Hungary is a strong and proud European country
					* most successful national consultation of all times
* how will then the state speak to the people ?
	* simply via its public news feed; the private media filters the information from it that is valuable [that is not personal political self-promotion or bullshit] and distributes it for its own business interest; this is what they do, what they earn money with
* example : the USA state never owned a media, and that worked well
