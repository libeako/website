* the technical side of democracy is the election; if that can be cheated then the ruler does not have to follow the will of the people to be elected, that is autocracy; hence the security of elections is fundamentally important
* still : developed countries left this wisdom by running insecure election systems; such countries were USA, Lithuania, Germany, Hungary and probably many more
	* cyber voting

* necessary requirements of an election system
	* security of an election system must include the following properties :
	* accuracy
		* the published result must correctly show the rightful votes of the people
			* every person with right to vote must be able to vote and only for once
			* the published result must be the sum of the actual individual votes
	* verifiability
		* the people must be able to verify that the actual accuracy is reasonably good enough
		* at least envoys of the competing political parties must be able to directly verify this
	* secrecy
		* the votes of individuals must not be known by anyone else than the voter itself
		* the secrecy must be trustable by the voters
			* even the suspicion alone by the voter that its vote may not be secret affects the vote
		* even the voter itself must be not able to prove its vote
			* without this the votes can be bought or pressured
* the paper ballot method
	* these requirements are fulfilled by the traditional paper ballot method; at least for some fundamental degree
* often applied, but not secure methods

* the fact that (the people accepted the application of not secure voting systems) proves that it is much too easy to decieve the people to give up democracy
