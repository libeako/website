* the fundamental property right
	* every human owns itself
		* by "itself" i mean its biological self [body, mind, thoughts, judgements, believes, memories, feelings, lifetime]
		* itself is the most important property of a human
		* physical aggression against a human is violation of itself as a property
			* the opposition of such aggression is classical liberalism
				* liberalism is for liberty of innocent activity, which is the absence of prohibition of innocent activity, which is essentially the absence of punishment of innocent activity, which is the absence of such aggression; that is : liberalism is the respect of the itself property of humans
			* most theft is performed via taxing and most taxing is based on such aggression; hence most of theft is done by violation of the itself property; hence classical liberalism [respect of the itself property] is practically almost the same as capitalism [respect of all properties]
* derived property rights
	* everything that is generated only by the property of a person - is the proprty of the person too
		* an important special case :
			* the human worker performs work by using only the itself; hence all the products of human work is the property of the worker
	* ownership of an owned thing can change by and only by the consent of the owner
