* often extra taxing is an awesome alternative to total prohibition
* tax too demotivates people from the objected act; it is a partial prohibition; the size of the tax controls the level of prohibition; though usually tax does not demotivate so strongly as a long jail sentence : it is still an awesome alternative when total prohibition is not necessary [for example : drugs], because instead of the significant negative side effects of prohibition : it generates revenue for the state
