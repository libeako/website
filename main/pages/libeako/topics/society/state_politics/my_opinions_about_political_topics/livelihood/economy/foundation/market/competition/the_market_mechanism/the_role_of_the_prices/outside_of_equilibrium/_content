* the actors and environment of the economy are always changing in practice; technological development, natural, demographic changes, ...; accordingly: it also changes what the optimal economical behavior is; hence incentives are necessary to make the actors to make the necessary changes to move toward the ever new optimal; with simplified phrasing: this incentive too is given by the market mechanism: it incentivises the actors from the negatively profitable [it takes more resources to produce the good than the usage value of the good] to the positively profitable
* hence the market prices are correct even outside equilibrium
* if the state by destroying the differences between the profitabilities of the different activities [for example by extra taxing outstandingly profitable activities]: destroys the healthy incentive to do better, destroys development of the economy
* an example
	* the computing industry grew immensely in the previous decades; it must have been very profitable to motivate this growth; it was; if the states destroyed this profitability [for example by extra taxing] then the growth would not have happened; if the states decreased this profitability [for example by extra taxing] then the growth would have been slower
	* the development of computing was incredible both in hardware and software, giving as invaluable ability in work, research, entertainment, love, politics, everything; where we are today was not even imaginable before this development
	* if the states prevented [or slowed] this development then still we would be communicating with computers via punched cards, and not only Youtube would be missing but even monitors too; you would not read this text either, but would perhaps be watching the heavily biased news from the media concentrated in the hands of a few state-connected individuals, through a black-and-white TV device, that one of your neighbors happen to own, and during that you would be amazed by how developed technology is that you can watch the world through a box and how people-friendly your rulers are to protect you from the "unfair extra profit" that big corporations could have
		* what is a "punched card"?

	* now please think: what is the enemy of people really? profit or the populist rulers using the jealousy of the people against successful businesses; was the profit of the computing industry an "exploitation of the poor" or was it a correct and healthy signal and incentive for an economic behavior that was good for the whole humanity?
