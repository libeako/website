* the patent system should be abolished
	* it is not enough to patch it; to correct it is impossible, because even its theory is mistaken
* some improvement  suggestions
	* decrease the protection time
		* also because the speed of the development of technology increased by much lately
	* restrict the fields of validity
		* the different engineering fields differ from each other significantly in how the patent system affects it; for example the pharmaceutical industry perform expensive tests, but in the software world everything consists of a set of simple ideas
		* stop the patentability of software
		* stop the patentability of ideas
	* let the patent not take away from the previous discoverers the right to use
		* at least not when it can prove the precedence [for example with time-stamp]
	* let attacking patents be easier
		* if a patent is attacked [because for example its triviality] and as consequence the patent is invalidated then the cost of the attack should be paid by the patent owner, because it is the one who made mistake, who caused the bad situation [a bad patent existing] and by that unfairly harmed others; also : to compensate that its patents constrained others during the time of its existence : it should pay to the state
