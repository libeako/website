* when the tax rate depends on actions of the tax subject in the past
* for exmaple if the tax rate depends on the size of the firm in tha past; but individual humans may also be subject of such tax, for example : people with university diploma
* such tax is especially bad
	* they increase some of the negative effects of taxes
		* it is more unfair because taxes something that was lied by the state to be free
		* its negative effect comes later
			* this is why politicians especially like these
				* politicians generally steel the future

		* it is very powerful tool for corruption
		* it is less predictable [more risk]
			* risk is real economic cost

	* it motivates owner change
		* tax that is based on the past creates a tax rate difference between firms operating equally in the present; by this it motivates the firm taxed more to melt into the one taxed less, it motivates owner change
		* owner change consumes considerable amount of real economic value : business planning, valuations, legal, administrative tasks, accomodation of the customers, ...
* some concrete tax types by the past :
	* sudden debit tax
		* it is the sudden robbery of a part of the debit
		* it should be considered by the past because it is applied so suddenly that the debitor can not save out its wealth before the tax is realized
* because of the significant extra cost that such taxation carries : the constitution should prohibit it
	* this will be very important in the near future, because a big state-defaulting is coming around the globe, in which situation the politicians will certainly want to apply such taxation too
