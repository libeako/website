* if a side of a market has competition then the price in the equilibrium will be such that it is just worth to participate at that side
	* because :
		* if it is not worth to be at the side then some leave until it becomes worth to stay
		* it if is worth to be at the side with extra profit then that attracts more participation to the side, the side grows and thus it becomes less worth to be at the side until the force [extra profit] stops
* this just worth price equals to (the total cost in case of the supply side) and to (the usage value in case of the demand side)
* hence the price in a market with competition at both sides [most markets] equals to both the total cost and the usage value
	* more precisely :
		* the price is equal to the marginal cost and usage value
			* what is "marginal"?

		* it is not the present values that this is true for; those are usually not in equilibrium; but the average of their expected future values [depending on which the market participants make their decisions]
* optimality
	* economical
		* the equalities between the supply and demand in equilibrium  means that the economy produces the amount of a good that is wanted - that is : produces the optimal amount of the good; thus the market mechanism organizes the economy into an optimal state, behavior
	* social
		* economical exploitation is not possible
