* scandinavian countries were relatively capitalists, for 100 years, that is the time interval when they built up their now good economy, from nothing
* when they increased their shocialism : their economy growth rate got lower
* taxes are not the only usual burden on economy; the freedom of trade and the rule of law remained high in scandinavia, which compensated somewhat the taxes being high
* shocialism in scandinavia lost some of its popularity, as its disadvantages became more apparent
* norway had much oil in the ground
