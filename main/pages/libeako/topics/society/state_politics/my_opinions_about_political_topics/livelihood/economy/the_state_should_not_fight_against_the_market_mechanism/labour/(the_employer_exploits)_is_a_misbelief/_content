* proof
	* if the employer exploits then the employee moves to an other one; some people then say : "but employees generally exploit; i can not solve the problem by moving to an other one, because that one exploits too"; this is also false; if this was the case then it would be worth for new employers [or new capacity of old ones] to arise who would exploit only less, still profiting by the employment, but providing a better deal for the employees, attracting them over; this would force all the employees to also raise wages, and this continues till the attraction is not possible, when the wages are already so high that extra profit is not possible
* causes of this misbelief
	* under-appreciation of the contribution of the entrepreneur
		* the wage of the entrepreneur is its profit; people usually feel that it is too much; but they usually do not consider the extra that an entrepreneur contributes to the business, which should be compensated by the profit too :
		* capital
			* the entrepreneur usually brings capital, forgoing the yield that it could earn on it through regular investments
		* risk
			* that big capital can be lost totally, easily, quickly; perhaps the entrepreneur can even get jail sentence for mistakes in tax reports or in connection with regulations
				* risk is real cost

		* the entrepreneur does better work
			* then the other employees; it is usually to say that the entrepreneur wakes up and goes to bed with its firm in mind
			* this is because for the entrepreneur the difference between the possible outcomes in the success of the firm [becoming rich or losing everything] is much more motivating
	* success is much more visible then failure
		* the rich status of the successful entrepreneur catches the eyes; those though who lost their fortune usually get lost unnoticed in the uniform mass of average people
