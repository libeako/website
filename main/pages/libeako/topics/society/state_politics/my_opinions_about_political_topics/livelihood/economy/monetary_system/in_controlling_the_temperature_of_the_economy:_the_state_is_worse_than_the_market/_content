* private speculators are better; they risk their own wealth [or their clients'] and hence are better motivated to understand the economical situation better; their interest coincides with the interest of the economy : what they do is smoothing the prices, including the stock prices and by that the temperature of the economy; central bankers are incentivised in serving their delegators, that is the political elite, whose interest is to neglect the interest of the economy and create ever more money to spend and allow accumulation of ever more debt by lowering the interest rates

* famous recessions, as failures of the central banks are
	* the big depression since 1929
