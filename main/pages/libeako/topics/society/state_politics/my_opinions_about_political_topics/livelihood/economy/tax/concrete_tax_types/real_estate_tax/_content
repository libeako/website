* taxing real estate is much better than taxing economical activity
	* it requires relatively almost no violence
	* avoidance is much less
		* real estate can not be hidden
	* much more fair, because
		* pure economic activity [food preparation, giving advice, ...] does not hurt anyone
		* but owning a real estate does
			* restrains other people from entering
			* occupies scarce resource; that even could be used better [important road, mine]
			* isolation is a threat to others; the owner can
				* pollute the ground water
				* hold someone captive
				* hide stolen stuff
				* prepare bomb
				* ...
