* what is rent seeking ?
	* honest economical behavior to gain some already existing economical good
		* this definition is perhaps not precise but is basically correct
* the name "rent seeking" is misleading; it does not have connection with rent
* rent seeking harms the economy
	* because it is waste of resources
	* economical activities consume economical resources; this is true for regular economical activities too, but those also produce new economical value, more than what they consume [otherwise it is not profitable hence does not happen in a free economy]; but rent seeking consumes so that it does not produce; rent seeking is to gain *existingvalue; it is worth for the individual actor, it gains something, but the whole society does not
* the biggest rent seeking is drove by the state, trying to heat the economy by giving away wealth [robbed from tax payers] by tenders
	* see why heating the economy is stupid

* the amount of the waste
	* the overall waste is what the actors spend; how much is it?
	* i describe here concretely the rent seeking created by the state, usually through some tenders "for economical development"
	* the applicants grow their efforts for the "rent" till they expectedly are worth, that is till the value of the gift by the state is more than the cost spent on gaining it [otherwise it would be too attractive business to not take part in it]; thus the cost will be equal to the value of the gift; that is the whole value of the gift is spent on getting the gift, it is not a gift actually, it is just wasted
	* corruption in the state tenders
		* the economy is better if development tenders by the state happen with corruption; because the crony has advantage in winning the gift from the state due to its personal connection, hence it needs to spend [waste] for it less
* a very nice video explaining rent seeking
	* Giving Away Money Costs More Than You Think
