* from the previous description you hopefully see that the prices and profitabilities set by the free market mechanism are correct; both in and outside of equilibrium; by correctness i mean that they lead to optimal economical behavior
* important conclusion
	* if the prices are distorted from what the free market mechanism determines then the behavior that they lead to is sub optimal
	* the state often distort prices from their economically correct value; either intentionally [for example by price constrains [for example wage minimum]] or as a non intended consequence of some intended state action [typical example is taxing]; the economical actors will continue to base their decisions on self interest, but the prices then being distorted will lead and incentivise the actors to suboptimal behavior; thus the state decreases the efficiency of the economy
