* the wage equals to the business profit that the employee generates for the employer
* this contains the costs [of employment] too, with negative sign
	* such as
		* taxes on employment
		* costs of labour regulations
			* medical examinations
			* safety insurance
			* the constrains on layoffs
			* the cost of rehiring after a break in the employment [after giving birth, military service, illness]
* an important conclusion
	* the cost of obligations of the employer is subtracted from the wage; and hence almost all employer obligations are gross negative; it forces that some of the wage should be paid in some state-determined way [treatment, guarantee, ...] instead of regular wage; but such change can be achieved by the will of the employee too, it only needs to ask from the employee : "look, boss : i would be satisfied by less wage, spend the difference on improving my work environment, ..." - for the employer it does not matter if the money goes on wage or whatever, as the employee prefers; if the employee does not make such request then it is because it values the extra wage more; the state obligation just forces the choice away from the employee
* other taxes
	* in the economic sense : all the taxes are paid by the employee; even the ones that are legally based not on employment, like corporate tax; because taxes decrease the profit of the firm, and by that the profit that the employee makes for the firm too
