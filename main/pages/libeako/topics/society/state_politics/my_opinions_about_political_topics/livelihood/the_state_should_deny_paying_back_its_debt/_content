* more accurately: the state should only roll over its debt, that is pay it only from new debt taken specifically to pay the existing maturing debt; that is the state should not pay back debt by taxing
* if rollover is not enough then:
* who should suffer?
	* the candidates :
		* taxpayers
		* politicians
			* they are the biggest culprit, but they are not responsible legally and their personal wealth is only an insignificant portion of the debt
		* those whom the state gifted
			* pensioner, unemployed, ...; they can not afford
		* the creditors
			* letting them suffer the problem is equivalent to denying paying back the debt
	* hence only 2 candidates are viable choices : the taxpayer, the creditor; we have to choose from them
* solution:
	* the one who suffers should rather be the creditor
* worries:
	* "nobody would will to trade with the state"
		* the state can pay in advance
			* programs bigger than a political cycle can be ordered in pieces
	* "there may be emergencies when the state really need to get credit, but it would not if it is not a credible pay-backer"
		* such emergency is almost non existent; but if happens then : 
			* the state usually gets help anyway without the requirement of paying back
			* the state can take that debt into a separate fund from the dept taken in normal times, use that fund transparently only for the advertised purpose and then consider it an exception to my suggestion.
* detailed explanation by concrete aspects
	* economy
		* paying back by taxing makes more harm to the tax-victims than not paying back does to the creditors; because of the extra cost of taxing
			* link to the 'cost of taxation'

		* willing to invest
			* let us distinct 2 kinds of investors : 1 : financial, 2 : real economical
			* the 1 gives credit to the state, which according to historical experience the rulers spend not to solve temporary problems but to over-spend for short term personal interest at the expense of the future; this harms the country; not paying back discourages such investors
			* the 2 creates real economical goods with its investment; whether it comes to the country and whether stays is significantly influenced by the tax; which is increased if the debt is payed back; hence these kind of investors highly favor not paying back the debt
			* hence not paying back the debt discourages the harmful investors and encourages the useful investors
	* how can we get rid of the debt ?
		* paying back state debt is politically impossible

		* trusting in the honesty of the ruling is very naive; the only other option is to take away the ability of the ruler to borrow; not paying back the debt achieves this by discouraging future creditors
	* who deserves to suffer ?
		* creditors are somewhat culprit in the debt, because they for personal financial gain [the interest] enabled the past rulers to operate an unmaintainable fiscal politics for their own personal interest
		* we can not similarly blame the taxpayers
	* morality
		* moral says that debt should be payed back; but it should be payed back by the one who borrowed; the taxpayers were not the one who built up the debt; forcing someone else to pay back debt is not only not moral obligation but it is an immoral act
