* if > 1 person is at a side of a market [who do not cartel] then they compete against each other in the price, they try to provide attractive deal
* "market with competition" = market, having competition at both sides of it
* in this part i talk only about markets with competition; for the shortness of the text i often omit mentioning it, but when you miss it then you can just assume it implicitly 
* exchanges
	* exchanges are voluntary [in a free society]; both participants of an exchange has to agree, otherwise the exchange does not happen
	* someone agrees to an exchange iff it is good for itself
		* hence all exchanges that happened are good for both sides
	* someone agrees to an exchange iff it is the best for itself
		* otherwise it would be worth for it to reject the exchange and choose a better one
		* hence all exchanges that happened are the best one for both sides
			* hence the state prohibiting some exchanges ["regulation"]: hurts both sides of the prohibited exchange
* marginal values in macro-economics
