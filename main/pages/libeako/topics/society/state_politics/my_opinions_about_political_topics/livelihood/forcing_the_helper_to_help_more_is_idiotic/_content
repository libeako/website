* shortly: because the helper may stop even helping at all
* this part is about a totally stupid method of shocialism; by "total" i mean that even the most determined shocialists should realize that it is a bad idea, just by a little rational thinking
* let us think as a shocialist
* we want Y to be supported; we need to force some X to do it; who that should be?; the stupid idea is that that should be people who already supported Y, voluntarily; this idea is stupid because by this X is effectively punished for helping Y previously, which demotivates it in doing so, over time it builds the cost of the extra support into the price between them, by which Y ends up supporting itself; even more: additional problems arise from the law [typically: risk, beaurocracy, rent-seeking], the cost of which must also be on Y, otherwise X is not willing to do the interaction; either case happens: Y ends up in a worse situation than without the law
* a good example of such shocialist policy is eviction moratorium, in which the burden of providing housing for the non-paying renter is put onto the owner of the appartment; note that the owner already helped the renter when their business relationship started voluntarily
* an other disadvantage of this method, independent from the previously described one, is that the burden on X is concentrated; which is generally less efficient than uniform taxation
* what would be the solution in the housing example with uniformly tax distribution?; the state would simply support the renters who it wants to be supported, financed by regular [uniformly distributed] taxation
* summary
	* concentration decreases the efficiency of taxation generally; but if the tax is put on the person who already helped then in addition the original goal is also hurt, even in the short time and in long time the effect is even turned to opposite direction
