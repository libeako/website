* the state wants to incentivise innovation, hence it want to give some gift for innovations; the gift is monopole right to use the innovation in a time interval; this this is a deal between the state and the innovator; the innovator gives the description of the innovation and the state gives the monopole right
* is this deal worth for the country?
	* if the innovation would not be discovered by others in the time of the state protections then theoretically yes [but even this is false - the explanation of this claim is later]
	* if some would discover then it is questionable
	* if the innovation is just a few simple ideas, that would have been trivial for those who start to work in the field then the  deal is surely bad for the country, because it prohibits the competition unnecessarily
	* if the state would be a good dealer then it would estimate the difficulty of the innovation
	* but this can not be done by the state [more precisely : by officers], because this task is
		* difficult
			* any difficult innovation can be well judged only be the best experts of its field, which patent officer are not
			* patent officers must judge patent request from multiple fields, they can not be experts of all of them
		* subjectiv
			* hence the judgement is easily unfair or corrupt
	* this was known by the designers of patent laws and hence the patent systems do not contain such estimation; thus the state is giving monopole rights in an automatic manner without considering the net outcome for the country
	* many patent systems require that the patent content may not be "trivial", but
		* this is subjective
		* does not prevent patents for not trivial but easy discoveries
		* in practice very often ignored
