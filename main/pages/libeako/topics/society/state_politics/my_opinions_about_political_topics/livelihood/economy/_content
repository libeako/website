* bankruptcy
	* bankruptcies happening simultaneously is bad
		* bankruptcies happening simultaneously can increase their harm by multiple times; financial collapses can affect the real economy, and they strengthen each other's effects through real economic and financial relationships
	* the state should not incentivise debt
