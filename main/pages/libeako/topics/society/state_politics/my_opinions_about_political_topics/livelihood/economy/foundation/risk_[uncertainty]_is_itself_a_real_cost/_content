	* loss is stronger then nominally equal gain; for example : the loss of our only home is more bad then the gain of +1 is good
* examples
	* investments
		* financial advisers first ask about your willingness to take risk; if you walk into any bank asking for investment opportunity then they will first tell you that the more risk you are willing to take the more profit you can expect; because an investment opportunity with higher risk to remain competitive must compensate the extra risk with extra profitability
	* wage
		* let us assume that your employer tells to you that from now your wage will be not fix, but sometimes it will be 2more and sometimes 0, deciding randomly but without bias; let as assume that it can not cheat [for example the randomness comes from lottery numbers, commodity prices and other sources combined]; you can be sure this would not be an exploitation of you; would you agree to this change? why? because you know that uncertainty [risk] is bad for you; how much fix increase in your wage would the employer need to give you in order to convince you to take the deal? that extra is the cost of your risk
* for same reasons business people, even big corporations try to avoid risk; their limit of risk taking may be much higher, but the underlying mechanism is the same for everyone; risk is a cost for everyone
* an important conclusion :
