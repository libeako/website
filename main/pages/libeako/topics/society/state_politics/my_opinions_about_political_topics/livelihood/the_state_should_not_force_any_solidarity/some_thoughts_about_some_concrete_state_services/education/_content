* the importance of knowledge is great and continues to grow fast
* but (state education) =/= learning
	* the goal in the state education is to acquire a degree
		* according to experience
	* the goal of learning is to acquire knowledge
* the 2 are different and barely overlap; those who learn for the degree forget after they get it
* people overestimate the importance of degree in job seeking
	* taking part in the institutionalized education is not requires for business success; the reality is more practical : the employer want the good work of the employee; that is determined not be degree but by attitude
		* one can become even hyper rich without higher education; for example John Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg did not get degree
* real knowledge can be acquired only by curious learning; the state education practically does not contain such thing
* instead of state education ...
	* internet is the best educational source
		* now one can learn almost any science on the internet : math, physics, chemistry, biology, human healing, computer science, programming, law, architecture; the material for learning these available on the internet is already better than the universities provide and they continue to get better fast
		* one learns that and then what and when wants to
		* no exam stress
	* learning during working is awesome
		* advantages :
			* the student's goal is not a degree, but the improvement of its productivity and hence wage, which is a much more direct and hence stronger incentive
			* the student immediately sees the sense in, the need for the learned knowledge
			* most of the learning happens unconsciously, which is much more efficient learning
			* a private employer teaches only what is really useful
			* a private employer is more flexible, accommodates faster to the chancing world
		* learning while working was the main, natural method of learning of humanity for thousands of years, it was diminished only in the previous 100 years, by statism, mainly concretely by the following changes :
			* wage minimum requirement
				* more about the wage minimum

				* even though it is natural that those who are learning the work produce significantly less and even do more harm than good as they are asking the help of their colleagues
			* take over education
			* prohibiting child work
* other sources
	* forcing children to learn is a horrible idea
