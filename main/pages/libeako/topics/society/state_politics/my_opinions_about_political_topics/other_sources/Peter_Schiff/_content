* i recommend that you follow Peter Schiff; he is a libertarian analyst, in economics, politics
* his youtube page
	\ links-to external https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIjuLiLHdFxYtFmWlbTGQRQ
* why do i like him?
	* he is good as a fact-source
	* his speech style
		* his english is simple, understandable, i can interpret it without any concentration, with leisure; so is his argument; i specifically recommend this, to learn from it, his excellent speech skill, both his concrete arguments and his style; for me it is a leisure and pleasure to listen to him
		* he is not boring, despite that he often repeats his thoughts; because his libertarian passion is still there and he is honest - this can be felt in his speeches
		* he did not bend into a youtube-star role
