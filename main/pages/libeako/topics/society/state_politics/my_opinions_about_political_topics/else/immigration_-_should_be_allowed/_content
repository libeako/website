* the negatives of immigration can be huge
	* immigrants form isolated ghettos, separate, hostile nations in the nation
		* immigrants are usually less productive in the economy
			* because they are less trusted, have less personal connections, know the language less
		* this causes them to be relatively more affected by the wage minimum requirement
			* the wage minimum requirement prevents people with lowest productivity to get job

		* hence they work less, hence they do more crime and this isolates themselves even more from the native people
	* immigrants can take over the country
		* over multiple generations they can acquire citizenship, even only by allowing one citizen into the family tree early; as the distance in the family tree increase - the nationality inherited from the native citizen fades, but the citizenship stays total
		* the reproduction rate is often bigger of the immigrants
			* perhaps because they earn less by work
		* this means that the immigrants are likely to acquire significant voting power, that is significant portion of the control and possession of the country
* the positives of immigration are huge
	* the immigrants get a better, often much better opportunity for life, work
	* utilitarian positives for the natives
		* the presence of the new people is new business opportunities, which increases the efficiency of the economy
		* the immigrants pay tax
* hence whether to allow immigration is a hot topic and people often have strong opinion on either side, causing heated debates
* what follows is the capitalist solution of the question, with which everyone wins
* you may think that these suggestions may in some way be bad for the immigrants or their descendants; but even if you do : you still should support this solution as a compromise, because this would still be much better for the potential immigrants then keeping them out
* control over the country
	* one can give a place to live to a homeless without transfering the property right of the apartment; in the same way : we can let immigrant in without giving them property right over the country, without giving them control over the state; the only thing needed for this is to not give them citizenship; then they do not have right to vote and hence can not influence the state; almost everybody would agree to this, to that immigrants should not be gifted with citizenship; but the problem comes back with mixed children; whot about those whose parents have exactly 1 citizenship [one of the parents is citizen and the other is not]? should these children have citizenship? most native people would choose to give these children citizenship; some half-immigrant children getting citizenship this way is not considered to be a problem by most native people; but in case of massive immigration this phenomenon gets massive too; once distinct immigrant communities are formed then the reproduction can und usually does continue mostly internally, keeping their foreign culture, remaining isolated; and during this : by the generations passing : the number of citizens among them grows exponentially; just because at least one citizen got into the community and reproduced, injecting the citizenship, which then spreads exponentially; this may result in an immigrant nation forming a nation inside the native nation, with political power, taking over and changing the country; many people do not want this and many are even terrified by the possibility of this; they then incorrectly conclude that the immigration must be not allowed; but the error really is not the immigration, but that the immigrants get citizenship; hence should the immigrants' children not get citizenship, even if one of their parents is a citizen? that is also quite bad; what if the states of both parents deny citizenship for this reason? at least one of them must, but then the question and problem arises : which one? and even if one does : perhaps the family wants to leave in the other country and raise their children accordingly; something is clearly erroneous with this strict citizenship choice too
	* one step towards the solution is to decouple from the citizenship the critical rights coming with it : the right to vote; giving citizenship may remain lenient as now, except the right to vote
	* then should the mixed children not have right to vote? that is bad in the same way as giving them full right to vote : not having right to vote can spread exponentially through generations the same way as the right to vote
	* mixed children getting full right to vote and getting zero right to vote are bad in the same way, just in the opposite direction; the solution is to give them exactly the average of the voting power of their parents'
	* such scheme would lead to the fragmentation of voting power at individual persons : persons would tend to have voting rights under many states, but with low weights; the solution to this problem could be the allowance of exchanges of voting rights, even for wealth, perhaps with the limit that a person's voting right can not be > 1
* the problem that immigrants do not work is easily solved by normal capitalist policy
	* i say "normal" because these policies should be applied even without immigration
	* do not give to immigrants shocial gifts
		* this is good policy anyway
			# links-to internal edikpgtixxflwhnx
		* then they can not live on the native people's work
	* let them work without the restriction of the minimum wage
		* then they will get job
		* the minimum wage requirement is bad anyway
			# links-to internal agvkrkvpekeesejk
		* "they take away the job from native people"
			* so what?
			* jobs are not static, the economy adopts to demographic changes too, the number of jobs grows if demand for them grows
			* "but they compete the wage down"
				* this as consideration is immoral, because it suggests violence against competition;
				* in some professions the market wage may drop but i feel that this effect is much overestimated
					* i feel that what mostly happens is that the wage of the immigrants go up [instead of the natives' going down] as they get into a more efficient economic environment [which can use their skills more efficiently]
				* more employee on the market is more business opportunity for the domestic economy, that is additional efficiency, that is addition in the average wage
					* link to how wages get determined

		* with the immigrants working they not only do not consume the tax of the native people but pay taxes and they form micro-social relationships during their work, including human friendships
			* and most of their criminal activity disappears
		* if domestic workers are to be subsidized [but they should not be] then a more efficient way to do it is by general taxing [instead of violent exclusion of employee competition], and even better is by tax cut for them
* controlling the number of immigrants living in the country
	* by extra taxing immigrants
		* changing the size of the tax
	* making the tax fix [independent from the activity, performance of the tax object] functions as a filter that selects the best performing immigrants to stay
