* this section of my website can be considered as a book, a capitalist propaganda
* it is for statist people mainly
	* but other capitalist propagators can use it to find good arguments in it hopefully
* it is very utilitarian, morality is rather only mentioned
* it lacks demagogy, popularity seeking, mostly dry arguments are instead
* i do not like artistic verbosity, i went for compactness
* the amount of repetitions is small
* the content is well organized
* one can easily find concrete, personally interesting topics and read them exclusively; links to other pages are present where necessary
* i plan to reserve the URLs of the pages [hopefully Github continues to host it]; hence this is good source to link for explanations, propaganda in concrete topics from fast online debates
* i plan to incrementally improve it in the future; i am happy to recieve suggestions
* i probably should re-read [and improve] the whole thing but i can not afford that now
