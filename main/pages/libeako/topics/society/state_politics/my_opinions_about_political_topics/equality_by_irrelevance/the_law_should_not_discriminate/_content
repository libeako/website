* the principle
	* the law should not discriminate people by the following properties :
		* nationality
		* gender
		* religion
		* sexual orientation
	* the state should not even know these properties about the people
		* because
			* this takes away the ability from the state to discriminate
			* the state does not need such information
		* more accurately
			* the law and the courts should not deal with such information; but investigators may; for example the skin color may be a useful information during searching for a suspect
* properties of the principle
	* is between the individual humans, not between the groups
	* is in front of the law, not in wealth or social success
		* is in the relationship between individual and the state
	* excludes positive discrimination too
		* which is negative discrimination
			* for the complementer set of people
	* excludes group quotas
* these groups do not really exist
	* the real groups are mixed
		* those are the important groups in which the members cooperate : family, friends, workplace, ...; and these are mixed in these human properties
	* the individuals are mixed
		* the transition between the groups is continuous, there is not sharp boundary between them; an individual is a mix of multiple groups; though the mix often contains a dominant group : there are many people who are righ at the middle between 2 groups, perhaps even the individual does not know which group it belongs to more
		* nationality
			* even the genes of the most national feeling individual are mixed
			* the children of the mixed couples may feel right at the middle between the 2 nationalities of their parents
		* gender
			* there are humans with definite gendered body and definite, opposite gendered sexual orientation
			* there are humans with female body shape, male genital, male voice
		* religion
			* this is a little bit exception, because most religions successfully convince their followers to not believe in the other religions, but here too : at least the transition between religion and atheism is continuous
		* sexual orientation
			* there are bisexuals
