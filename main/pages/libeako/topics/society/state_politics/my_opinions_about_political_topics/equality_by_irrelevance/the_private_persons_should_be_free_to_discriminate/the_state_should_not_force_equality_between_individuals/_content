* discrimination self interest [business profit, personal relationships, ...]
	* hence it is very rare
		* there may be a very small number of small firms who discriminate but it is easy to find an alternative instead of them
	* by this discriminators get their punishment for the discrimination by the market, by life; this natural punishment happens automatically, without aggression, without conflict, its size exactly matches the size of the discrimination; no need for an extra punishment from the state; the punishment by the state is extra, beyond the exact natural punishment, hence it is surely unfair
* other disadvantages of forcing equality
	* the talks are loaded with the weight of the law; people talk like lawyers, in a cold, distant-reserving style, producing uncomfortable mood; because people are afraid to talk, want to avoid even the suspicion that discrimination is there
	* it is probable that the rejected person can not clearly see what is the reason of the rejection; this is really bad because it confuses the rejected person and makes its search for an alternative unnecessarily difficult
	* it is economically expensive
		* even the chilling effect, but especially the official proceedings
