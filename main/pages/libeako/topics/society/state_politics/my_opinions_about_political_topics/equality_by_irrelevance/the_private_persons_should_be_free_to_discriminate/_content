* freedom
	* let everyone be free to share its body, life-time, wealth, working, with whomever they wont according to whatever preferences they want; because those things are theirs
* the prohibition of discrimination is bad for the society
	* it encumbers the economy [or whatever area it is applied to], because it is implemented by the restriction of the area
	* it requires extra legal knowledge and organization
	* the law must be forced and checked
		* it empowers the sate
			* increases corruption
			* pushes toward tyranny
* the state should not force equality between individuals

* the state should not force the equality between the groups
	* because such requirement :
		* is in conflict with the principle of equality between individuals
			* because :
				* the individuals have to be discriminated to achieve the final statistical equality between the groups
					* example :
						* if the law requires that the next approved member of board must be a female [to comply with a gender quota requirement] then a male candidate must be rejected even if he is seemingly better in every respect, just because he happened to be a member of the male group
					* this is unfair for the members of the disadvantaged group
