* the cost of indirection
	* motivation of human
		* a human performs better managing its own firm than the state's firm or authority
		* the goal of a private firm owner is the profit, which equals to the net affect the manager produces in the society - ideal goal; in the state the manager gets a mostly fix salary - the goodness of its work is much less reflected in its salary
		* corruption

			* methods of corruption

	* burocracy
		* to limit corruption : the operation of authorities is constrained by detailed rules; but that decreases the efficiency and the flexibility by much
* the cost of centralization
	* the state is centralized; the centralized nature is a weakness - it is easier to attack it and its potential outage is shocking [when it is off then it is off for the whole country in the same time]
