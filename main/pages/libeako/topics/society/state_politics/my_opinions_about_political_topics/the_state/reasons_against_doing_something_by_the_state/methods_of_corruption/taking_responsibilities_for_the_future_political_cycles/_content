* the interest of the ruler is to be popular; those of them are popular who spend much; but the long-time interest of the country is not in the interest of the ruler; because just few years ahead in time it will probably not be the elected ruler; even more : its interest is to make the future of the country so bad as possible, to be able to blame its then ruling political opponent for the bad
* this is why rulers like to sacrifice the future of the country for immediate spending and wasting
* some usual examples of this :
	* stacking up the state dept
	* inflate the state currency
	* warrenting loans of the voters for flat, education, ...
	* promising extra pension, "life-course", ... instead of proper wage in the present
