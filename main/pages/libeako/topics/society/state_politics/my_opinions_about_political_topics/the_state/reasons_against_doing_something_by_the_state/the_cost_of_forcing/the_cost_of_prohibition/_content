* all laws are in the form of prohibition or obligation; it is worth to think about the state from this perspective specifically too
* prohibition and obligation are duals of each other; i can think of both as a special case of the other; hence the arguments about one is true about the other too; even if i do not explicitly mention this for the simplicity of the text
* something being bad does not implicate that the state should prohibit it; state prohibition have some rarely known negative properties
* why not prohibit?
	* it icreases criminal activity
		* increase the ability to evade the law
			* such ability can be used to commit serious, moral crimes too
				* this can be seen via the example of alcohol prohibition in the USA in the 20th century -
					* it produced private mafias

						* as example : Al Capone
		* alienates people from the police
			* because of the secrecy : those people who commit the prohibited act but have good will do not dare to report other, connecting crimes, do not dare to help the police work in other cases either; for example : the client of a bordel does not dare to report because that would give up himself too [or if the bordel is run by a mafia, practiced intimidators, probably with strong connections in the police and justice system]; they miss reporting that some of the sex workers are too young or forced or drugged or beaten
	* it makes people voulnerable 
		* by both the mafia and the authorities
		* for example :
			* if [and mostly only if] sex work is prohibited then the sex worker needs to be afraid of both the boss, the police and even some clients
	* it destroys quality
		* examples :
			* if the bordel is legal then it can maintain a brand suggesting that the sex workers are not infected with sexually transmitted disease
			* this is especially important in drug usage, because prohibition usually makes it almost impossible to know what is the content of the drug material, how to dose it, usually it is not reliable, not clean, and even immediate poisonous syndromes and even immediate deaths happen because of this
			* ...
	* the law is not precise
		* it may be difficult or impossible to define the prohibited act exactly
		* which causes
			* the possibility of the abuse of the law
			* chilling effect
				* by this the people may be deterred not only from the act that the state wanted to prohibit, but also from other but similar, connecting acts; because people often do not know where the boundaries exactly are, what exactly is prohibited and whether the law is over-enforced and whether they are safe abuse of the law; as example : i myself am afraid to criticise persons, even if i think that they are deceiving their clients or voters, because i do not know whether that particular form of hurting reputation is legally safe

	* case judgments are not always accurate
		* no system is perfect, especially not one operated by the state, like the justice system; mistakes and corruption are present
