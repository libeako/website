* psychopath people are attracted into police; because police is paradise for them, as in police they get to do violence, they can feel powerful
	* a real story
		* YouTube star uploads video about her disciplining her dog, by hitting the dog; the dogs sin is jumping on her; the dog jumps on her to express its love toward her - this shows a sick human soul - punishing for love; then the dog forgives and shows love again; the owner should be grateful for such a loving dog; but she punishes the dog again; and again; she stands in front of the dog, knowing the dog is in playful mood, opens her arms, knowing that the dog would interpret that as invitation to jump on her; she knowingly invites the dog to jump and then still punishes the dog ofr jumping in love
		* she seemingly loves dishing out discipline
			* i hope she will not have children - imagine all those opportunities to discipline [even without her children inheriting her character]
	* the existence of such people and their attraction into police is one good reason to minimize the application of police [the sate]
	* most people love power, but some will even seek and falsely fabricate opportunities to exercise power even just to feel the power, not only cruelly against innocent unknown people, but even against those who love them and are totally loyal to them; in the past the victims of such police officers went to jail for assault; a lot of such cases happened; even in democratic countries; nowadays the situation is much better because of the body-cameras; but even with body cameras on we see a lot of cases when the officer could not resist (his | her) urge to escalate the situation
