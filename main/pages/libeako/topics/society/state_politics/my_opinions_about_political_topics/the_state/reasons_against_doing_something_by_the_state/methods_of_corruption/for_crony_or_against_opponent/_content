* leaking trading-relevant information 
	* this is the least known mode; but a most important one; because it is very easy to do it without getting caught; to prove that it happened is usually impossible [if the actors do not leak somehow]; just think about the official statements, even vague ones can move markets considerably
		* for example:
			* someone close to the decision knows that banks will get an extra tax; it informs its crony about the date of the official announcement; the crony has only to short bank stocks around the day of the announcement; even if someone notices it, to prove that the shorting was based on side-channel information leak is probably impossible
* trading with the state
	* selling state property
		* below market price for the crony
	* purchasing by the state
		* above market price from the crony
		* including fake purchases
			* "advising", "studies"
			* fake advertisements in crony media
			* ...
* competitive advantage for the crony
	* by general extent legislation
		* the ruler changes the ruling in favor of the crony or in unfavor of others
			* in controlling : the taxation is especially great tool for the ruler; it is enough to select a few business traits in which the crony differs from its competitors and create tax advantage for the crony; for example if the crony has a young bank then the ruler introduces a new extra tax on banks, based on some firm performance in the past [when the cronies bank did not even exist]
			* if the crony has small grocery stores then the ruler raises the food quality examination fee for big groceries or prohibits operating big groceries in sunday or ...
		* obstruction of entrance of new competitors into the market
			* with burdens
				* unnecessary administrational, "consumer-protective", "employee-protectee" constrains, which are easily more difficult for the smaller firms
			* mandatory licensing for operation and the licenses are decided individually or even limited in number ["concession"]
	* targeting individual firms
