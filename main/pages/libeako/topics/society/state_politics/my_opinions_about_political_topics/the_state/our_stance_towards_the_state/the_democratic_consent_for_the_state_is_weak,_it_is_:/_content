* not secure
	* the security of the voting systems is weak; voting frauds are possible, even frequent; even with most secure classical paper ballot system; for example : chain voting, photographing the cast vote
* not precise 
	* probably the voter does not agree with all the agendas of the candidate whom it votes for and just selects the candidate whom it considers the least bad one
* not accurate
	* the candidates usually decieve the voters
* not moral
	* all the voters have exactly zero right for aggression; hence they together also have zero right for aggression; they can not delegate right for aggression to the state because they themselves do not have such right; hence the right of the state for aggression [its right to exist] is not moral, but only legal
