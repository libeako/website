* the goals of such explanations are to
	* convince the people about the new tax
	* prevent the opposition to attack the new tax; politicians usually do not dare to talk against giving for food for poor children
* this is a lie, because
	* the money that the state collects by taxation is homogene; there is no difference between the units of it [between dollars, all dollars are equivalent] they are interchangeable, any of them can be spent on any purpose
	* matching a concrete tax with a concrete expense is valid if and only if that tax is the most hurting one and that expense is the least useful one; this is because
		* if we want to decrease expenses then we should decrease the least useful expense
		* if we want to decrease tax then we should decrease the most hurting tax
	* an example : that tax is not for the hungry children but for that new football stadium [or whatever least useful expense the state currently has]
