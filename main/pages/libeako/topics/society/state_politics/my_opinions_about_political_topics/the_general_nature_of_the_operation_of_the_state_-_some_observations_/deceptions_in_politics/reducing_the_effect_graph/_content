	* let us suppose that a politician wants to do change S [usually steal]; because of this it portrays change S in the eye of the people as good; for this: it explains that change S leads to change G, where G is good; its explanation is the effect-graph from S to G; the mistake is that the politician is silent about the path in the effect-graph from S to B, where B is bad
	* often G and B are changes with the same type, but opposing sign
* this mistake is very frequent in the economy topic because most people do not have the intellectual power to understand the market economy
* an example
	* S may be that the politician pours state money into the firm of the crony; its explanation is the following affect-graph path : (the state gives money to the firm) -> (firms are better off) -> (the economy is better off); the politician is silent about the following affect graph path : (the state gives money to the firm) -> (that money must be robbed from someone), which itself makes the net outcome neutral; taking into account the extra costs of taxation and rent-seeking we get that the act of the politician is strongly negative even on the parameter that it itself states as goal [state of the economy]; still : people usually believe these kinds of incorrect explanations
