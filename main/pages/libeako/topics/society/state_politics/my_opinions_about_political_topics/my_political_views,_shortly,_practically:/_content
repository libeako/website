* do not steal
	* theft is the cause of most of the problems of humankind
		* is the foundational enabler of stupid and exploitive politics [if one is allowed to steal then it does not have to convince]
		* generates conflicts
			* each war starts by one of the parties stealing
	* hence the application of theft should be frugal: any potential application of theft should be thoroughly reasoned for; as i see: this thoroughness is currently much lower than optimal, in almost all countries; drawing attention to and explaining this is my goal
