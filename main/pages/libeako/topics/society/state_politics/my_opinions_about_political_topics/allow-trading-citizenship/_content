* citizenship should not be needed for residing in the country anyway

* citizenship is an ownership over the country; not allowing selling it is a restriction on that as a property right; as such it is a robbery against the citizen; it is immoral
* the citizens who want to sell their citizenship sell anyway, in dangerous and harmful ways
	* selling their votes occasionally
	* voting for lords who poor out the capital of the country to the citizens
		* this is why the states became the poorest entities [they are deeply in dept], despite having the biggest, enormous revenues
		* this pooring out of the capital is often very inefficient
			* examples:
				* selling mineral material very cheaply
				* programs to help the poor
		* in contrast: selling the citizenship has perfect efficiency
* tradability would create market value discovery of the country
	* decapitalizing the country inefficiently would be an unattractive policy to vote for, as the citizenship's value [as a stock price] would decrease by it, by more than the outgained capital
* being afraid of rich people gaining too big control over the country by buying citizenships is not a good reason to oppose the sellability of citizenship; you can allow to sell even with some maximum limit on the individual ownership
