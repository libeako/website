* the traditional banking system are the banks which take in capital as deposits and invest it and promise fix yield on it in return
* problems with this business type
	* they promise fix yield on the capital
		* in the economical sense: this is a lie
			* becuase investment are always unsure, they may return less then the fixed promise by the bank
		* if the underlying investment return less then the bank's operating profit will be negative; the bank can run this for a while based on its reserves, but it is always possible that it will sometime run out of its reserve
		* when the banks runs out of capital then it can not pay back its depositors; at least not fully; instead of decreasing the payments towards all depositors proportionally, the bank tries to fulfill its promise that is the fix interest, till it runs out of capital, at which point the remaining depositors can get only 0 of their capital back; this situation is a rational reason for a competition among the depositors to take out their capital quickly, to "run the bank"; for a bank run to happen it is enough that the fake rumor of a potential bank run happens, if it is fake
		* this is the famous instability of the traditional banks
		* thus the instability of the traditional banks roots in the yield being fixed; but that is not theoretically necessary, it is only a stupid habit; banking can be reformed to get rid of the fixed interest; this requires only that banks take their capital not from their depositors but from their shareholders; lending banks should not have depositors
		* this additional risk incentivized additional care
			* the main measures
				* the modern states apply strict rules to prevent bank panics, but that just mitigates the problem, does not solve it, as it does not eliminate the root cause [which is the fixedness of the bank interest]
				* the modern states require bank insurance
				* the banks themselves apply strict risk analysis and constrains to prevent paniccy situations
			* all these measures have cost, which eat some of the yield of the bank
	* they mix accounting and investing
		* this is bad because 2 reasons
			* investing is inherently risky, accounting should be very safe
			* investing is mainly an economical analyst job, accounting is mainly an cyber tech job
* the solution
	* is to divide the traditional banks to 2 totally separated businesses
		* lending
			* this would not inherit the instability ["banking run"] of the traditional banks
		* accounting
			* this would not be linked to investing, hence would be very safe
	* this would inherently be much more safe and give more expected yield for the capital provider
* the traditional banking system is an example of
	* the common stupidity of the people

* the state should not save banks from collapses
	* if saving would be worth as busieness investment then it would be done by private high-capital entities and hence the state's help would not be necessary
	* the state may just let the traditional banks collapse, as it is bad practice anyway and let healthier solution arise on the place of it
		* you do not have to be afraid of this causing a collapse in the general economy, as the capital finds its best ways from capital-owner to capital-user [firms] just by their self interest, the state just needs to not be obstacle in those ways
