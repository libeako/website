* politicians against freedom of speech like to hide their attacks on the freedom of speech in the technicalities of speech; by constraining the usage of technologies for speech; hence the constitution should defend against these kind of attacks explicitly too
* terms :
	* "technic" :
		* the technical implementation of speech
	* "network provider" :
		* operates the technical side of the internet
			* transmits and controls the data traffic over its network
			* to customers : provides ability to connect to the network
	* "content distributor" :
		* makes material [normally created by someone else] available, discoverable, searchable
* the technic is practically the internet; but it must be defined generally; it also includes press, phone, ...
* serious criminals dodge the constrains
	* who prepares a serious crime : makes the effort necessary to walk around the technical constrains by the state on speech; hence state constrains are working rather over law abiding people; but over them it is harmful overall
* total freedom already proved
	* till 2010 there was no technical limitation on the internet in most western countries, and that did not cause significant problem
* content and source filtering
	* the constitution must prevent the state from filtering certain content or source [internet address]
	* on one side : nobody wants that everything was available on the internet [including recipes for chemical weapons for example], but on the other side : experience shows that constrains tend to be used by the ruler tyrannically; which is a much bigger danger; hence it is much safer to allow everything
* the responsibility of technic providers
	* technic providers must not be responsible for the actions of their customers
	* treating content distributors responsible for the content that they distribute [but did not create] is so sensible as treating bus drivers responsible for transporting criminals to the crime scene
	* such laws are tools in the rulers' hands that can be used [beside wealth corruption] to threaten content distributors to cooperate in tyrannical attempts [for example surveillance]
* individual access
	* the state must not constrain the access of the technic [for example the internet] by individuals
	* the danger of this is unfortunately serious
		* in France before 2015 was a law created to ban people from using the internet just because they illegally downloaded muic
		* in USA "sex offenders" can be banned from using the internet for multiple years and to get this badge it is enough to have sex with someone under 14
		* the banning from internet is mainly not punishment but prevention of repeating the prohibited act; but it is too strict against the not dangerous criminals [the internet is the main place of self-realization, work, education, ... - the most important aspects of our lives] and too ineffective against the dangerous criminals
	* the power to ban access to the internet carries the danger of tyranny
		* it can disable influencers
			* people without internet access can not get informed, spread its messages, defend its reputation in society against false accusations
* net neutrality
	* the state should not force it
	* though i am against discrimination : i think : discrimination is less danger than the ability of the state to intervene
		* the law prohibiting discrimination can be used as a weapon against the network providers to threaten them into cooperation in for example content filtering and surveillance [beside wealth corruption]
	* decades of allowing discrimination has already proved that it works okay in practice
	* in some cases discrimination is useful for the society
		* some clients buying extra bandwidth is does not hurt other clients and helps in the development of the infrastructure
		* privileging important low consuming usages [for example wikipedia] over not important high consuming usages [game streaming] may be good
