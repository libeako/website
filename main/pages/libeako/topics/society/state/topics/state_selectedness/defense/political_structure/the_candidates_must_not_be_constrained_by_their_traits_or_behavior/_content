* here the word "candidate" may mean not only individual, but also a political party
* the nature of condidate constraint
	* unnecessary
		* in an election the greatest majosty itselft, the citizenry have opportunity to reject candidates, by not voting for them
	* illegitimate
		* pre-selection of the candidates by the state is unnecessary constraint on the will of the people, hence is illegitimate; it is a usual method of state-selected regimes in practice too
* hence the constitution should deny the constraining of the candidates
* every voter should be entitled with the right of being represented in the parliament, even those with weird or 'bad' political views, that are hated by the majority
* the state should not be able to stop the candidacy concretely because of these either:
	* has criminal record
	* established and maintained a tyranny in the past
	* wants to kill all life on Earth
	* as a party or set of candidates they exclude wemen or whatever goup
	* they keep secret the identities of their [financial] supporters or the amount of support
	* does not have graduation
	* is old or young or ill
