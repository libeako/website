* some people do deserve death penalty, but that is not enough cause for the state law to allow death penalty
	* because the judicial system is imperfect [makes mistakes, is corrupt] and hence convictions may be incorrect, innocent persons may get convicted, but in case of the death penalty: it is not possible to make it back
* its additional good incentive on crime is questionable, because
	* the minds of murderers is crazy
	* they commit more murders [of victims] in trying more to avoid being caught
* especially harmful under state-selected regime, because then the heros can not hope in getting free at a later fall of the state-selectedness
