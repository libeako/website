* this part is to define a political regime type, which many people refer to by "dictatorship", "tyranny", "authorianism", ...
* the correct method to define something is to catch the essence of it
	* not more, not less; more would make the definition too narrow, less would make the definition too broad
* what is the essence of some system? -the working mechanism of it
* what is the working mechanism of such a political regime? -the way the political elite keeps the state in its hand: it uses the state power already in its hand to keep the state power in its hand
* we could say: the state selects the lord among the lord candidates
	* this is where the name 'state-selected' i took from
* an other way to say this is 'the state is biased toward some [usually one] of the candidates'
* the favoured candidate is usually the one in office currently [bossing the state], as it is him who decides who the state would favour
