* link to the definition of state-selectedness
	\ links-to internal fenxvbzqcdxjgobm
* quantity of state-selectedness := amount of state power the elite got from the state / amount of state power the elite has
* this amount is not binary but scalar [0 .. 1]
	* with other phrasing: about a particular political regime: the question is not whether it is state-selected but how much is it state-selected
* usually some state-selectedness exists in every state
* in some cases the state-selectedness is so strong that we can state that that regime is state-selected, in such binary manner
	* this is when the help of the state the elite has big political power but without it would have practically none
	* a test to detemine this
		* in a thought experiment: imagine that nothing from the help of the state did arrive to the elite in the past; how much popularity [and hence political power] would they have then? compare it to how much they have in reality
			* imagine their popularity if the state help did not arrive and not if the state help did not happen; the difference is important we must consider that the state did help, that they did command the state to help, because such command is illegitimate and illegitimate actions [commanding the state to be biased] must be accounted for when deciding whether they are state-selected
* totality is not necessary
	* a totality requirement in the definition is stupid
