* political propaganda by the state is generally bad; it is always the usage of state resources on the political goals of some of the political parties [under official explanations like 'government information']; the lord does not have authorization by the citizenry to distort the opinions of the citizens; it is the opinions of the citizens that should control the state politics, hence very much not oppositely
* hence the state-propaganda is
	* an obvious, strong, widely used tool of state-selectedness
	* wealth-corruption, as by it the government parties spend state money on their own political propaganda
* let us deny for the state to operate media
	* how will then the state speak to the people?
		* simply via its public news feed; the private media filters from it the elements that are valuable [that is not political self-promotion] and distributes it in its own business interest; -this is what they do
	* example: the USA state never owned a media, and that worked well
