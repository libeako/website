* freedom already proved
	* till 2010 for decades the majority of the internet was totally free and it was okay
		* we can think about this time interval as an experiment, and that it proved that freedom, even total freedom to communicate [with strong encryption, anonymity] worked well and without big harm
* freedom implies lack of obligation
	* secrecy is part of freedom of speech

* content and source filtering
	* the constitution must prevent the state from filtering certain content or source [internet address]
	* on one side: nobody wants that everything was available on the internet [including recipes for chemical weapons for example], but on the other side: experience shows that constrains tend to be used by the ruler tyrannically; which is a much bigger danger; hence it is much safer to allow everything
* the responsibility of technical providers
	* technical providers must not be responsible for the actions of their customers
	* treating content distributors responsible for the content that they distribute [but did not create] is so sensible as treating bus drivers responsible for transporting criminals to the crime scene
	* such laws are tools in the rulers' hands that can be used [beside wealth corruption] to threaten content distributors to cooperate in tyrannical attempts [for example surveillance]
	* access of communication channels and spaces - the state should not be able to constrain
		* not even for those who by this committed crimes in the past or suspected to commit crimes in the future
		* the danger of such constrains is real
			* in France before 2015 was a law created to ban people from using the internet just because they illegally downloaded music
			* in USA "sex offenders" can be banned from using the internet for multiple years
		* such constrains are
			* too strict actions against the not dangerous criminals [the internet is the main place of work, education, ... - the most important aspects of our lives]
			* ineffective against the dangerous criminals
		* the power to ban access to the internet carries the danger of tyranny
			* it can disable influencers
			* prevent innocent people to defend against false accusations
* protecting children from experience should not be done by violation of freedom of communication of adults
	* the censorship toward children can be operated technically by the parents so that it does not constrain the rights of adults
	* a generation is already grown up who could see anything on the internet; still they are okay, this freedom did not cause significant harm
* rubber laws are especially dangerous
	* the government can take control over the private organization and force them to do censorships, ...
* net neutrality - the state should not force it
	* decades of allowing discrimination has already proved that it works okay in practice
	* in some cases discrimination is useful for the clients
		* some clients buying extra bandwidth does not hurt other clients and helps in the development of the infrastructure
		* it is usually good to prioritize important low consuming usages [for example text messages] over not important high consuming usages [game streaming]
* serious criminals dodge the constrains
	* who prepares a serious crime: makes the effort necessary to walk around the technical constrains by the state on speech; hence state constrains are working rather over law abiding people; but over them it is harmful overall
