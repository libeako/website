* the technical side of democracy is the election; if that can be cheated then the ruler does not have to follow the will of the people to be elected, that is autocracy; hence the security of elections is fundamentally important
* necessary requirements of an election system
	* accuracy
		* the election-result published by the state must be true: correctly show the rightful votes of the people
			* every person with right to vote must be able to vote and only for once
			* the published result must be the sum of the actual individual votes
	* verifiability
		* the people must be able to verify that the actual accuracy of the election is reasonably good enough
		* at least envoys of the competing political parties must be able to directly verify this
	* secrecy
		* the votes of individuals must not be known by anyone else than the voter itself
		* the secrecy must be trustable by the voters
			* even the suspicion alone by the voter that its vote may not be secret affects the vote
		* even the voter itself must be not able to prove its vote
			* without this the votes can be bought or pressured
* the only secure method - the paper ballot method
	* the security requirements are fulfilled by the traditional paper ballot method; at least for some fundamental degree
* not secure methods
