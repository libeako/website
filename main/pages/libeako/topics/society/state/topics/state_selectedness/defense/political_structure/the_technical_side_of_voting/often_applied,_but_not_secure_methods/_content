* by paper mail
	* if the originality of the signatures is not verified [mostly this is the case because of the difficulty of verifying hand writing signatures] then it is possible to vote under someone else's name; all is needed is to know about someone that that person itself is not going to vote, which is often not difficult
	* the voter can prove its vote by preparing and sending the vote in front of an other person
	* the vote may be compromised in the mail service
		* this can happen selectively, like dropping the votes from those whose votes are expected to be for or not for some candidate
			* for example people may go around and offer their help in performing the voting and those voters who refuse may be listed
* cyber

	* in the traditional (paper ballot - urn) method the ballots are observable physically; an ordinary human can observe an urn, count ballots, interpret the votes, without special equipment or competence
	* but actual computers work as black boxes for humans; humans can not verify the internal operation of computers
	* usual stupid arguments about the security of internet voting
		* "the "Estonian model" has been working for many years and their is not complaint against its operation"
			* the lack of complaints is not a security guarantee
			* the lack of complaints is often not because the system is secure, but because the citizens do not care about the security
		* "we can securely bank online, hence we can securely vote online"
			* this argument is so sound as the following: 'we are able to safely fly with aricafts, hence we must be able to safely submerge in sea with aircafts
	* never, nowhere was a secure cyber voting held
	* instead the security of cyber voting is only in the speeches of the lords and in the [stupid] brains of the ordinary citizens, but with full confidence there
	* why is it difficult to design a cyber voting system?
		* try yourself and you will see; spend the effort: invent a secure system, just the theoretical fundamentals
			* try at least for some minutes
		* what is difficult in this?
			* the election operator must take the votes into account which it may not even know individually [the votes must be secret]; this is difficult enough [try to solve it, most people would not be able to solve even these requirements], but this taking into account must also be done provably [the operator must prove to the voter that its vote was taken into account correctly]; with this proof the task is even more difficult, but also this proof has to be done so that the voter can not forward it [he may not be able to prove his own vote]
