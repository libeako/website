* civilians should be allowed to share state secrets
* foreign intelligence agents [with the big tools behind them] can get state secrets much easier then civilian people; hence the civilian defense layer of the state secrets is weak; on the other side : rules often use the laws that force civilians to keep state secrets to silence their rightful opposition regarding their personal corruption secrets
	* a good example is

* hence publishing state secrets must be free for civilians
* though obligations voluntarily taken by state employees [army, secret service, police employees]employment contracts to keep state secrets could still be enforced
