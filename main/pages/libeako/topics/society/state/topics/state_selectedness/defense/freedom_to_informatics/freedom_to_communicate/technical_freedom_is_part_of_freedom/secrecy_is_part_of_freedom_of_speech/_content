* being able to keep secret from government is an important defense against tyranny; because people must be not afraid to speak and organize against the government; a best way of this is to do it secretly, anonymously; hence the constitution should deny the prohibition of secret speech
* some possible consequences of prohibition
	* the ruler can see into the secrets of opposing politicians, gaining blackmail-ability extra-power over them
	* the ruler can see the revealing material of investigative journalists, including the identities of whistleblowers
	* the ruler can see the technical and business secrets of firms, handing those over to cronies, who can use it as unfair competitive advantage
* serious criminals dodge the prohibition
	* serious criminals can easily walk around the technical constrains of the state and are probable to ignore the state's prohibition of secret speech; hence the prohibition of secret speech is ineffective against serious criminals
* by type of secret
	* secrecy of participant ["anonimity"]
		* anonymity is a special case of secret speech, when the secret is the identity of the speaker
		* anonymity must be allowed
			* the state must not prohibit the anonym usage of the technical communication channels [computer and phone networks, ...]
			* though the state could still investigate the identity of an anonym person
	* secrecy of message content ["encryption"]
		* as part of an effort to weaken secrecy of speech: many politicians wants to ban encryption (without having a backdoor for the state); this is technically not possible without significantly decreasing the secrecy against other parties too
