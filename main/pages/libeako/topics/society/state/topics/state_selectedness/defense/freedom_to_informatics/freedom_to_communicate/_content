* communication is the best way of handling conflicts, of countering wrong acts
	* least dangerous, cheapest
	* among the bad things to be counterd by communication is state-selectedness; freedom-to communicate is the best defense against it and state-selectedness is the biggest danger to freedom to communicate
* hence freedom to communicate is the most important political value of any society to defend
* hence it should be guarded strongly by the base law
* freedom already proved
	* for a decade the majority of the internet was totally free; and this did not cause big harm; we can think about this time interval as an experiment, and that it proved that freedom, even total freedom to communicate [with strong encryption, anonymity] worked well and without big harm
* lying should be free

* political support from abroad
	* support of politics from abroad should be free
	* we do not have reason to assume that [financial] support of politics coming from abroad is more dangerous or harmful
	* tyrannies have much less control over support coming from abroad; hence it is crucial for them to obstruct those
	* also: there is no other reason to constrain support coming from abroad other than tyrannical
	* summary: constraining support of politics from abroad is tyrannical
