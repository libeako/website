* the task of the parliament is to mediate the will of the people; it does this the better if the content of the parliament is more proportional to the will of the people; that is: in an ideal political system the number of seats in the parliament a political party wins is proportional to their popularity
* but:
* the rules of the election and political system is written by the big parties; their interest is to make the system to favor the big parties; often they do so
* the political system over-proportionally favoring the big parties is always a manifestation of tyranny, as the small parties who lose by it can not change it
* almost all tyrannies apply this tool
* this tool is a most important pillar for almost all tyrannies
* one advantage of over-winning often advertised is "government stability"; but this is advantage only for the same reason that tyranny is advantages; but: just because tyranny has advantage too ["stability"]: we should not move towards it; in case of proportionality, many small parties occupy the parliament, who need to agree about the government; government instability can arise only in case of disagreement, that is only if some of them strongly doubt the intention of the biggest parties; but such doubt is often valid, and then it is desirable that the biggest parties can not ignore the opposition
* the most applied way of over-proportionally favoring big parties is to make votes lost
* votes should not get lost
