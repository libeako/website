* this part contains alternatives of the 'state-selected regime type' concept; they are all bad in my opinion [not accurate or not useful or ambiguous or...]
* general problems
	* most of them are ambiguously defined
	* some of them seem to require 'absolute' power
		* that is wrong
			* 'absolute' is often incorrectly used as synonym of 'total' and i guess here too
			* to require totality is a stupid choice in the design of this concept

	* some of them at least partially lack the 'infinitly recursivity' problem
		* perhaps the most important characteristic of state-selectedness is that to get rid of it is an infinitely recursive task
	* some of them require the perpetrator to be an individual
* concrete alternatives
	* 'dictatorship'
		* loaded with the 'totality' problem
		* i guess it requires individuality of the perpetrator
		* according to Wikipedia: this word comes from latin and means a judge who got 'absolute' state power temporarily
			* temporarity excludes the 'infinitely recursivity' problem
			* it was not the highest position in the state
		* if we assume that it means something like "to dictate"
			* that is bad because dictating can be perfectly healthy, normal, moral and legitimate
				* example
					* employer dictates to voluntary employee
					* parent dictates to child
	* 'authoritarian'
		* even wikipedia is ambiguous about it, mentioning both of these
			* something like statism
				* but that does not necessarily involve capturing the state for personal goals [at least not theoretically]
			* weakness of the competing candidates
				* but that may be caused by not the lord misusing the state power
	* 'tyrant'
		* according to wikipedia this comes from an ancient latin word meaning illegitimate ruler
			* i feel that this is the closest to 'state-selectedness'
				* but illegitimate also is true for those who lie to their voters, which is a very different kind of problem than state-selectedness, it does not include the 'infinite recusivity' problem
	* 'despot'
		* loaded with the 'totality' problem
		* requires individuality of the perpetrator
	* 'hybrid regime'
		* usually used where 'partial state-selected' should be used
		* partiality as a hybrid between empty and full - this is wrong way of thought
			* partial state selectedness is the same type of phenomenon as total state-selectedness, the difference is only the depth, strictness, amount
			* examples
				* a 15 year old is a 'hybrid' between a 10 and a 20 year old?
				* 2 dollars is a 'hybrid' amount of money between 1 and 3 dollars?
