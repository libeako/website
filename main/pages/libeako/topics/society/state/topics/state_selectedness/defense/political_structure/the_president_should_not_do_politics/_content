* a very wide-spread belief is that the presidency is a political office; the truth is the opposite: the president is the one single person to whom doing politics should be the most forbidden
* we need to separate the presidency from politics in order to minimize the state power concentraion
	* the more state power is in somebody's hand - the more easy he can 
		* gain more state power
		* keep the state power already in his hand [make it difficult to replace him]
		* commit sins with the illiegitimate state power
	* state power concentration is one of the important and most dangerous tools of tyranny ["state-selectedness"]
* a solution to avoid state power concentration is the parliament
	* the essence of the parliament is that it contains many members; by this: its power is distributed across many people, abuses of the power require cooperation among them, keeping secret becomes more difficult; these obstacles are defeatable for them, but still are a big difficulty relative to a sitation where all the state power is in one human's hand; this is what makes the parliament relatively reliable
* that the parliament is slow, late, can not keep secret - makes the parliament unfit to boss some branches of the state; such branches are the military, police, ...; hence the parliament delegates the bossing of these branches to individuals - the "ministers" or "secretaries"
* the job of some of the ministers sometimes require synchronization; hence normally an individual position exists above the ministers - this is the "prime minister" or "president"; i will rather use the word "president" because of its shortness
* the power of the president is exceptionally high relative to other positions
	* this is why normally in tyrannies the president is the tyrant
* hence it is important to minimize the power of the president; the power to the president is delegated from the parliament; hence this delegation must be restricted to the tasks that the parliament can not do itself!; hence the parliament must remain above the president, the maker of political decisions, the maintainer of the principles and laws!; the president must stay within the framework determined for him by the parliament and execute the decisions of the parliament!
	* this is why it is often said that the presidency is the "executive" branch of the state
	* the word "government" is also often used but this is a very bad name choice, as it suggests that the job of the president contains the governing of the country, which is not only false but also is the violation of the most important task of the president 
* what is the most important task of the president?
	* almost all the possible negatives of a president is small, as the parliament can easily cease it, by replacing the president; one important exception exists: if the parliament can not remove the president; that is when the president controls the parliament; hence this type of president is the worst; it is not enough to have an institution with the name "parliament", as if it serves the president then it does not do its main task, which is the division of the state power; hence the most important task of a president is to resist the attraction of the illegitimate state power, the extension his power onto the parliament; this must be the main task of the parliament and of the people too when they select and oversee the president; hence an important task of the president is to help in this task of the parliament and the people; as part of this: to prove his own non-dangerousness so far as he can; as part of this: the president must avoid even the appearance of him having or (trying to gain) power over the parliament!; as part of this: he must avoid having any demand toward the parliament; he must not use the power of the presidency to anything other than the legitimate tasks of the presidency, hence he must not use the power of the presidency to do politics; he must not even use the public interest toward him to popularize his own political opinions; hence the president not only does not have to do politics, "govern", "lead" the country, but he must be forbidden from these; he is the single person for whom doing these is the least okay; even a regular citizen have basic right to do politics, influence the content and behavior of the parliament by opining; not the president, because of conflict of powers: mostly for us to avoid him getting over the parliament
* how can a parliament be under the president?; usually so that [the majority of] the members of the parliament are afraid of the president or are paid by him
	* such a situation is when the president can influence the selection of the members of the parliament; he may do this via the parties; the parties are the main influencers of the selection of the parliament; hence the president must keep himself away from the parties; especially he can not be important person in a big party [important officer or supporter]; not only he can not be such but neither his subordinates [ministers, advisors, ...]
	* such a sitation is when the president uses the police or secret service or state money distributation in relation with the members of the parliament or their families
* the politician and the president are separate jobs, with very little fair overlap; they require different skills and pose different difficulties; this is why it is suspecious already when politicians run for the presidency; but in today's practice: not only they run for the presidency but when they win the presidency they keep their political positions [for example party positions] and they bribe members of the parliament with jobs in the executive branch and similar; this is happening in politically developed countries too; that they are "politicians", "leaders", they have to "govern" - is said by themselves but also by the analysts and the media; this is a very dangerous mistake and misleading
* that the presidency is a political job is just a very big
	* common stupidity of humanity
