* "against terrorism"
	* state censorship does not defend against serious terrorism; serious terrorists can relatively easily bypass state censorship, ignore possible state punishment
	* tyranny is the biggest terrorist
		* tyranny is based on terror, serious, systematic, continous terror over the whole population
* "for unbiasedness of information"
	* the state can not enforce unbiasedness; because bias can easily be covert; on the other side: laws obligating unbiasedness of information are tools easily and likely used by tyrants to silence opposing media
* "for the mental health of the children"
	* a generation is already grown up who could see anything on the internet; still they are okay, this freedom did not cause significant harm
	* the censorship towards children can be operated technically so that it does not constrain adults
* "emotional sensitivity"
	* of people is far from enough reason to constrain the freedom of speech
* "protecting individuals"
	* the state must not defend the following things of individuals :
	* reputation
		* the best method to defend against wrong behavior is the uncovering speech about that bad behaviour; it is the best method because though often weak alone, but is peaceful, as such it is much less dangerous than the alternatives
		* hence people should be free to spread negative opinion about and negative statements about the behaviour of other persons; shortly: to harm the reputation of other persons; this is why the state should not defend the reputation of persons
	* sensitive stuff

	* personal data
		* this is not important goal, there is no significant reason for it
		* but the state defense makes communication and cooperation significantly more burocratic
		* though the state could still enforce the data secrecy obligations which are voluntarily taken in contracts
