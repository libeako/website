* does freedom of speech contain the freedom to lie?
	* morally: no
	* legally: should
		* otherwise the system may obstruct speech of truth too; with other wording: legal prohibition of lying is a prohibition of truth-telling too practiccally, hence freedom of speech should legally contain the freedom to lie
* foundation with X Y Z
	* X talks to Y
	* according to Z:
		* X's talk is false, hence it is very harmful,
	* hence Z wants to obstruct it; what methods do Z have? the obvious method is
		* Z can contact Y, telling its problems about X's talk, then Y decides if it continues to listen to X or changes its opinion about X according to the warning of Z
	* this method is accepted by everyone; as it avoid physical force and hence it is surely without danger, cost and violation of rights
	* but Z may find this method too weak; Z may want to avoid the cost of talking to Y or may be afraid of not being able to convince Y
	* the big question: then may Z apply harsher method? may Z beat or threaten X to force him to stop talking? should the society allow this for Z? with other wording: should Z be allowed to silence X with physical force?
	* no
	* because:
		* it is not certain that Z is right; not even if Z is very certain; if Z does not succeed in convincing then X and Y may have good reason to stay with their earlier opinion; the necessity of convincing is a safety feature preventing false opinions to spread and unfair treatment against X
		* Z's motivation to stop the talk of X may be selfish, perhaps X's talk hurts Z's personal interest; hence Z's claim that X's talk is false may be malicious lie, pretense to attack X
	* what if Z represents the majority of the people? [perhaps Z is a democratic state]
		* still no, very much not; physical silencing is especially applied by tyrannies; this alone is very good reason to deny physical silencing
	* what if Z is the majority of the people? perhaps voting directly for a certain aggressive silencing?
		* still no; if the majority of people thinks something then that fact alone is strongly convincing
* the 2 methods to resolve conflicts in society
	* peaceful discussion
		* this brings people closer to each other, lets one teach the other
	* physical force
		* this creates possibility to unfairly oppress, poisons the relationships between the people, creates enemies; perhaps latently, but always
