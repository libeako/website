* does freedom of speech contain the freedom to lie?
	* morally: no
	* legally: should
		* otherwise the system may obstruct true speech too [mistake, corruption]
			* with other wording: legal prohibition of lying is a prohibition of truth-telling too practically
* the 2 methods to resolve conflicts in society
	* peaceful discussion
		* this brings people closer to each other, makes them learn from the other
	* physical force
		* this creates possibility to wrongly oppress, poisons the relationships between the people, perhaps latently, but always
* foundation with X Y Z
	* X talks to Y
	* according to Z:
		* X's talk is false, hence it is very harmful,
	* hence Z wants to obstruct it; what methods do Z have? the obvious method is
		* Z can contact Y, telling its problems about X's talk, then Y decides if it continues to listen to X or changes its opinion about X according to the warning of Z
	* this method is accepted by everyone; as it avoid physical force and hence it is surely without danger, cost and violation of rights
	* but Z may find this method too weak; Z may want to avoid the cost of talking to Y or may be afraid of not being able to convince Y
	* the big question: then may Z apply harsher method? may Z beat or threaten X to force him to stop talking? should the society allow this for Z? with other wording: should Z be allowed to silence X with physical force?
	* no
		* because:
			* it is not certain that Z is right
				* not even if
					* Z is a group of people, much more numerous then X
						* the majority opinion is dominant anyway in the society, no need to force it
					* Z is very certain
				* that fact that Z did not succeed to convince suggests that Z is wrong
					* the necessity to convince is a safety feature
			* Z's motivation to stop the talk of X may be wrongly selfish
