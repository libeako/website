* state of emergency is almost always an illegitimate and bad reason to suspend pillars of defense against state-selectedness
* lords striving for state-selectedness love emergencies; they even lie or orchastrate emergencies
* some rights that should not be suspendable at all even in emergency
	* freedom of speech
	* freedom of association, organizing groups
	* freedom of assembly and protest
	* the power of the parliament over the government
	* banning state propaganda
	* the freedom for support for politics from abroad
	* property rights
* even contrary: in an emergency the decisions of the political elite are more important, hence the democratic control over them is even more important
