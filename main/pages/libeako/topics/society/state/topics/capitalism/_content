* i am a capitalist; extremely, certainly, passionately
* names
	* "capitalism"
		* because we oppose the robbery even of capital
	* "liberalism"
		* because
			* the most important property right is freedom
				\ links-to internal gnrainmfkykgrvfn
	* "libertarianism"
		* just an other variant of "liberalism", because "liberalism" was hijacked by fake liberals
	* "voluntarism"
		* because we oppose all non-voluntary interactions and support the right for all voluntary interactions
* defining axioms of capitalism
	* multiple of them exist, they are practically essentially equivalent
		* 'the individual owns itself'
			* iff it acknowledges the same about others
			* in opposition to king, democratic majority or "society" owning us
			* known as "self-ownership"
			* the rights are all property rights and much stem from self-ownership

		* 'do not aggress'
			* known as
				* the 'non-aggression principle'
					* shortly "NAP"
			* most of the harm of aggression is from the robbery variant of it; robbery is stealing using of physical force; 
				* most of the robbery is committed by the state
					* hence this axiom may be simplified to 'the sate should not rob either'
				* much of the state activity is robbing
					* this is why capitalists are thought to be anti-state
						* but the truth is that we are not against the state, we are against only the robbing parts of the state
							* it is a mistake to think that the state must rob

		* 'voluntary => we support the right for it, involuntary => we oppose it'
			* hence the name 'voluntarism'
		* 'not helping others is a right'
			* most of the robbing is committed by states forcing individuals to help some other people
		* 'innocent and non-faulty individuals should not be punished'
			* most of the robbing is committed by states punishing innocent non-faulty people
				* violating illegitimate laws of illegitimate states is not a crime
* for capitalists
