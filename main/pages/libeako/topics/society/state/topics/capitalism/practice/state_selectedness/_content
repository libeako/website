* this part is about a political regime type, which is referred to by other poeple by "dictatorship", "tyranny", "authorianism", ...; i define it accurately, name it and describe it
* my name choice for this regime type is "state-selected"; you will see why in the definition
* definition of state-selectedness

* naming
	* "dictatorship"
		* i do not like this word because 
			* according to Wikipedia: this word comes from latin and means a judge who got "absolute" state power temporarily
				* but :
					* "absolute" sounds like total
						* which [as i already explained] is not a necessary trait of the danger that i am discussing here
					* it was temporary
						* but one of the most core characteristic of the danger that i am discussing here is it being permanent
					* it was not the highest position in the state
			* even if we assume that it stems from something "to dictate":
				* it is not a good fit, because dictating happens also in other relations, which are not dangerous [for example: in the employee-employer relation]
	* "authoritarian"
		* even wikipedia is ambiguous about it, mentioning both of these : 
			* something like statism
				* but that does not necessarily involve capturing the state for personal goals [at least not theoretically]
			* lack of competitiveness among the ruler candidates
				* which is too broad
					* for example : some candidate being able to raise less money for campaigning can also be interpreted so, but that situation is not part of the vicious circle [the opposing candidate may be the one who gets more money]
	* "tyrant"
		* according to wikipedia this comes from an ancient word meaning illegitimate ruler
			* i feel that this is the closest to the danger that i am describing here
* state-selectedness is bad
