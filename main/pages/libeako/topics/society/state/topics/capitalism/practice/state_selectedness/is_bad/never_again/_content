* when it comes to historical mass killings of innocent people people often say 'always remember', 'never again'
* this is a good practice in theory
* but in actuality
	* most of them do not understand what caused the horrible events; hence they put the aim on incorrect thing; with that they divert not only their own attention but of others too
	* they think that the cause was
		* hate, exclusion, ...
			* nope
				* these alone can not hurt
				* these are not even generally bad things; bad people do exist, excluding them is sometimes a healthy or even only okay option; healthy practice may not be the culprit
			* nationalism
				* even this can not hurt alone
			* communism
				* communism is not dangerous on its own; close family [as household] is communist society too
	* the cause really was state-selectedness
		* all of those horrible historical events were made by state-selected regimes
