* inter-country war
	* state-selected regimes are much more probable to create inter-country wars
	* this is the biggest problem with it, as the danger of war technology increases exponentially [nuclear, viruses, artificial intellgience] both in maximum capability and in geo-spread; it is not overstatement that the human race can get destroyed in a big modern war
* it is difficult to get rid of state-selectedness
	* this is because this task is infinitely recursive:
		* to get rid of state-selectedness
			* the people need to replace the state-selected lord at the next election
				* alternatively the people could demand a change in the political rules, closing the state-selected elements - but this possibility is usually blocked  or is effectless under a state-selected regime
			* but for that
			* the people first need to take away the state from them which is helping them in the election
			* which means
			* the people need to replace the state-selected lord at the next election
			* - and so on forever
	* this is why the people should reject any development of state-selectedness the sooner the easier and better
	* the ability of state-selectedness to stay is growing exponentially with the advencement of information technology that the lord can use to monitor the people
* state-selectedness is a slippery slope
	* usually it is an accelerating downward spiral, which get somewhat reset only when the main lord dies
* state-selectedness worsens the society
	* it oppresses or even destroys good people
	* it lifts bad people into power
* state-selectedness is illegitimate, even democratically
	* hence it becomes a machninery against either the truth or the will of the majority of the citizens
