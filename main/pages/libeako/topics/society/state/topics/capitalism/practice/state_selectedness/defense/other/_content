* political support from abroad
	* support of politics from abroad should be free
	* we do not have reason to assume that [financial] support of politics coming from abroad is more dangerous or harmful
	* tyrannies have much less control over support coming from abroad; hence it is crucial for them to obstruct those
	* also : there is no other reason to constrain support coming from abread other than tyrannical
	* summary : constraining support of politics from abroad is tyrannical
* even in emergency
	* state of emergency is not good reason to suspend pillars of defense against freedom
	* tyrants and wanna be tyrants like to suspend the pillars of democracy; state of emergency is an excuse for that; but it is an illegitimate excuse in the sense that there is actually no reason to believe that the democratic pillars should be weaker in an emergency
	* for example here are some pillars of democracy, and hopefully you can see about them one by one that they should not be suspended at all during any emergency :
		* freedom of speech
		* freedom of assembly and protest
		* froodom of organizing groups
		* the power of the parliament over the government
		* not allowing state propaganda
		* the freedom of support for politics from abroad
	* even contrary : in an emergency the decisions of the political elite are more important, hence their democratic control is more important
