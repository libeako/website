* marriage should be free
	* between any humans
		* even between
			* same sex humans
			* > 2 humans
		* because
			* this does not hurt others
	* extra legal requirements should not encumber it
		* some examples
			* the participants should not be forced to [financially] support each other
			* violence inside marriage should not be punished more strictly
* the state should not incentivise or support marriage
	* because
		* marriage is not a public goal
			* not even for making children
		* whether some people love or support or use each other - is their private business
	* example:
		* the state should not give extra gifts to married humans compared to non-married ones
* internal conflict
	* the state should not have the punishment for marriage-internal crimes more strict - that is punishing the marriage too
	* the state should not assume guiltyness, but as generally: should assume innocence until proven guilty
	* the state should not force the wealth of one of the participents to the others, let them arrange this according to their own explicit voluntary commitments
