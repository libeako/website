* it is a very wide-spread belief that 'dictatorship' implies full state-power of the lord
* the 'state-selectedness' is a more accurate concept, at least more accurately defined; it should be clear from its definition that it does not require that the state-selected lord has full state-power
* the totality requirement is not necessary at all
* all the essential properties of state-selectedness are true for partial regimes too, just with less amount; hence the restriction of the concept to only the totalitarian ones is a big mistake
	* it is not necessary
		* i guess that the only cause of it being invented is that the inventors did not know better how to define the general 'state-selectedness' concept
			* even though it is very easy to discover, but the average politologist is not okay with even that amount of thinking
	* such a concept is useless
	* it did and does a huge amount of harm
		* as it teaches to the people that no need to worry before the regime becomes total
			* this is true even if this was not the intention and even if some of the users of it explicitly say otherwise
				* as this effect is present among the people
					* i have got many times from ordinary people that 'if it really was dictatorship then you would not dare to say that'
					* i have seen in my country even the opposition to not dare to say 'dictatorship', 'tyranny' ... on such a regimes, because 'dictatorship' would be total
			* this did help the partial state-selected regimes a lot
	* it is even a crazy mistake, as almost all state-selected regimes are partial
	* this is one example of
		* common human stupidity
