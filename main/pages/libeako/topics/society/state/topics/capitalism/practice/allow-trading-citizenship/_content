* citizenship should not be needed for residing in the country anyway

* citizenship is an ownership over the country; not allowing selling it is a restriction on that as a property right; as such it is a robbery against the citizen; it is immoral
* the citizens who want to sell their citizenship sell anyway, in dangerous and harmful ways
	* selling their votes occasionally
	* voting for lords who poor out the capital of the country to the citizens
		* this is why the states became the poorest entities [they are deeply in dept], despite having the biggest, enormous revenues
		* this pooring out of the capital is often very inefficient
			* examples:
				* selling mineral material very cheaply
				* programs to help the poor
		* in contrast: selling the citizenship has perfect efficiency
* tradability would create market value discovery of the country
	* decapitalizing the country inefficiently would be an unattractive policy to vote for, as the citizenship's value [as a stock price] would decrease by it, by more than the outgained capital
* being afraid of rich people gaining too big control over the country by buying citizenships is not a good reason to oppose the sellability of citizenship; you can allow to sell even with some maximum limit on the individual ownership
* compare how people get private services and state as service
	* for example computers
		* people do not know how the computers are made, not even how they work, they do not know who the bosses of the manufacturers are, what are they busieness strategies, nothing; people are still calm about this situation, they still get their computers and those computers are very good; only those people vote who are deeply into some of the manufacturers, as big shareholders; they are extreme experts of those firms; even small shareholders of the firms do not even think about wanting to vote, they know their opinion is not worth the vote, they know they are not knowledgable enough to vote
	* this is how it should be for states too; normies do not know state politics, how the states work, they do not even care about it; such stupid-in-the topic people as normal people voting is not healty; their votes are bad, the candidates easily play with the feelings and mental fallacies of the stupid voters
* allowing unconstrained trading of citizenship perhaps requires the states to be small territorily; so that in case of somebody bad or illegitimately takes over a state - the danger and damage of such event be small
