* the states should allow secessions
* the existence of a state is moral only if it has the consent of all its citizens
	* democratic election is not strong enough consent
* but now almost now states have such consent
* a remedy to this problem is that these state allow secession for their non-consenting citizens
* feasability
	* the difficulty of this is rather political; most states would not allow secessions, mainly because the majority of their citizenship opposes it
	* the technical feasability is expensive but still easier than the political battle
		* the secession starts with a mother state and results in a mother and a daughter state; think of the daughter state as the one seceding from the mother state
		* political parties above a threshold in election result should make the decisions about a concrete secession
		* the party publishes a new base law ["constitution"]
		* each of the citizens [of the mother state] decide whether they like this new base law more or less then the one of the mother state; some will decide that they like the new base law more; they will lose their citizenship in the mother state and by that acquire citizenship in the daughter state
		* the mother state selects a part of its terrritory (at the border with other countries) - this will be the territory of the daughter state
		* the first election into the parliament of the daughter state is held by the mother state [among the citizens of the daughter state only - of course]
		* initial relations of the daughter state with other states [millitary, freedom of trade, ...] may be pre-arranged by the mother state
