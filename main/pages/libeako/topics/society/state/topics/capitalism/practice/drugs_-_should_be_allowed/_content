* the posession, consumption should be allowed
	* the law against possession is a weapon against anyone
		* the attacker needs just to hide drug in the apartment or car or suitcase or pocket of the victim and then anonymously "inform" the police to search for it
		* police itself may hide the drug before finding it
	* police can freely harress people with the excuse "i smell weed"
	* the prohibition of possession and consumption frightens away friends of the consumers
		* as they do not want to get near illegal activity, for their own safety
		* this hurts the addicts; they lose supporters, guards and without friendly companion they even get more into drugs too
* supply [production and distribution] should also be allowed
	* this is the sake of the consumers
		* prohibition does not allow brands, hence the composition of the material is
			* unknown
				* even the material coming from the same source is changing
				* overdosing happens often
			* unreliable
				* brands can not exist
			* often [very] poisonous
		* the freedom to distribute indlucedes the freedom to advertisement
			* freedom of advertisment is also supported by the freedom of speeach
* a nice compromise:
	* extra-tax instead of totally prohibit
