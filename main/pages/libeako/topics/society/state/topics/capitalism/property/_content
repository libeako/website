* the fundamental property right
	* every individual owns its own body iff it respects the same right of others
		* 'its body' includes its mind, thoughts, judgements, believes, memories, feelings, lifetime
		* this is freedom

		* this is the most intimate and important right
* derived property rights
	* everything that is generated only by the property of some persons - by that it too becomes the proprty of those persons
		* an important special case:
			* the human worker performs work by using only its body; hence all the products of some individuals' work is the property of those individuals alone
	* ownership of an owned thing can change by and only by the will [like consent] of the owner
		* including exchange, charity, inheritance
		* violating the right to give or take property right is a violation of the right of both parties [the would be giver and the would be taker] [both of them are harmed]
			* what matters is not a formal treaty between them but their willing to do the exchange; the formal treaty is only a technicality, a proof of their will
			* example: violating the right of someone to talk or to listen wiolates the right of both the talker and the listener
