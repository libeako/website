	* using state-selectedness of x to prevent the opposiing y winning and forming state-selectedness is a bad method to prevent state-selectedness
		* the popularity of x would probably fall
		* the popularity of y would probably rise
		* when y eventually wins then
			* y may cease all the state-selectedess and that is a big sudden help for it, from a situation when it is already winner; the big popularity and power may incentivize the lords getting used to that power to want more, even with state-selectedness
			* y may just keep all the tools of the state-selectedness to work for y
	* death penalty - is bad
		* it as an incentive is questionable, because the minds of murderers is crazy
		* the conviction may be incorrect, innocent person may be convicted - there is no way to make it back
		* especially bad in tyranny
