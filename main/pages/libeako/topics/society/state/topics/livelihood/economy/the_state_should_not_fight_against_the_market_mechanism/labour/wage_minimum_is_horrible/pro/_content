* here i list the most well known arguments pro the wage minimum; i debunk them individually:
* 'the wage minimum does not destroy jobs'

* 'the age minimum increases efficiency by motivating the employee to produce more and decreasing employee turn-over
	* this is true mainly only relatively [at the micro level] when comparing different jobs; but absolutely [at macro level] this effect goes away
	* forcing people to output more is not good but bad, for them too; we can assume that organically people work so hard as is optimal for them; then the wage minimum forces them up to a sub-optimal level
* employers have local bargaining power 'advantage'
	* this works in the other direction too
		* to the extent that it is difficult for the employee to change city: it is also difficult for the employer to attract the employees back; difficulty of moving between cities does not stop the employees from moving, just slows the movement; slow leakages of employees are still unsustainable for the employer
	* pre-known advantages are calculated into the investment of the employer, thus pre-known advantages does not cause extra-profit for the employer
* it is okay to rob from the employers for the employees [for example with wage minimum] because the employees will spend that extra money to buy stuff from the firms which is approximately the same set of actors as the employers
	* this is obviously absurd

		* as voluntary market exchange is not the opposite of forced gifting
