* export - import = foreign trade balance; this is sometimes positive and sometimes negative; this is natural and healthy; other countries export into yours in expectation to do the reverse too, even if later; there is not point in giving economic good to someone without getting something in return; thus the foreign trade balance is expected to converge to neutral; hence no need for the sate to "boost" the export
* the state's attempt to boost the export flips out
	* if the export is artificially boosted then less economic resources will be available for domestic demand, which boosts import; boosting the export boost the import too; the state may achieve boosting the export, but not the balance; what the state achieves is the boost in transport over the country border, which is economical and environmental harm
* the state's attempt to boost the export comes with the state spending, which is partially financed by abroad, which in the real economy corresponds to worsening the foreign trade balance
* summary
	* the state trying to force the foreign trade balance to the positive side : not only causes real harm in wealth and the environment, for a goal that is totally unnecessary, but can not even achieve the goal, even more : it achieves the opposite of the goal
