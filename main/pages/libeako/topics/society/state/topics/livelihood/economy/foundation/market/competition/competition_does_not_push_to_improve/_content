* economic development, such as cost getting lower or usage value getting higher of a product type, is often attributed to the free market competition among the suppliers of the product; this is wrong; competition in a side of a market does not push its actors to do well; the development is not "pushed" or "driven" or "incentivised" by the competition; it is just the realization of economic growth which is the result of human work and hence its incentive is the same as the incentive of human work generally; people work not because they want to be relatively good among their competitors; but rather because they want to make a living, as good as conveniently possible; what competition does is only the prevention of getting that living with less performance than what other people need to perform

* analogy
	* a car is "pushed", "driven" by the engine, as it is the engine that gives the force to move; the steering system only steers the already moving car to the right direction
	* similarly the drive of economical activity is the desire to have convenient long life and competition only steers the economical activity to the right direction: a fair and optimal one

* a John Doe who is not a lawyer is crap as a lawyer, a worst among the lawyers; still it does not bother him at all, he never even thought about this fact ever, let alone being bothered to study law; because competition alone does not push him; still: he very much tries to work well in his own profession; because he makes his living with his own profession; hopefully from this example you can see: it is the desire to live well what pushes people to do good job, not competition; competition only prevents them to achieve that goal by less performance than what other people have to perform
