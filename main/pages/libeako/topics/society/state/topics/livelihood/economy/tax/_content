* campaigning with tax reduction promise is not moral
	* the only real tax reduction is expenditure reduction
		* those candidates which do not take the opportunity to teach against a wrong expenditure, let alone those which do not even dare to say which expenditures they would decrease - can not be trusted to really decrease
	* those candidates that do this are not honest, hence not trustable
	* by promising tax reduction they show their lack of honesty
