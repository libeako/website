* the important quantitative properties of a market
	* the price of the good
	* the quantity of the good
* the markets are usually in motion [the properties above change through time]
* the price of a good changes much more flexibly, quickly, easily than the quantity of the good
* the change is always towards equilibrium, which is the equality between supply and demand; this is the "market mechanism"
* the equilibrium price is one at which the market is in equilibrium
* the people in a free market follow self interest; hence they go to that market's that side which is good for them; the better it is the quicker they go there
* the change of the size of a side of a market affects how good it is to be at that side; the good side grows, hence the price changes so that it becomes less good to be at that side; for example : it is worth to produce something => more of it will be produced => its price decreases => it becomes less worth to produce it; the same in the opposite direction : the bad side decreases, hence the price changes so that it becomes worthier to be at that side
* this is the "market mechanism"; the bias drives the market towards the equilibrium; this happens spontaneously, it does not require force, central control, thus it does not require state
* thus the self interest of the persons in the market incentivises them to move the market toward equilibrium
* in equilibrium

* moral
	* in a free market economy : though actors follow self interest, that leads to trading; in a free society trade can happen only voluntarily, hence it must be good for both sides; hence trading is doing good to others
	* even more is true : the actors consider their and others' sake equally, as the cost of production and usage value of any good must be equal
	* competition prevents unfair extra profit
