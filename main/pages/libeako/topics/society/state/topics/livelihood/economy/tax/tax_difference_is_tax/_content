* by tax difference here i mean the situation when the state decreases a tax rate by increasing an other
* to decrease a tax from r to r-s: an other one needs to be increased from r to r+s; some people's first feeling may be that this is okay, because the state decreased and increased taxes by the same amount, causing a net neutral effect; but because the marginal cost of tax grows as the tax rate grows: the cost caused by the tax increase is bigger than the cost saved by the tax decrease - the tax increase is heavier than the tax decrease
