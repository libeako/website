* this is it, this is why we have wage-minimum, right? no; it is still bad; getting wage increase forcefully is not good for the employee; it is done by preventing the market from low price, and that causes that supply is higher than demand, a stress in the market; this for the employee manifests in being more difficult to find job, and when got then more difficult to keep it due to the competition for the job being higher and the supply of it being lower
* this of course causes the employer to increase the requirement, the difficulty of the job
	* hence the employee needs to
		* work harder
		* do less pleasant work
		* decrease the number of mistakes made
		* take more emotional stress
		* take more responsibility
		* ...
	* the overall goodness does not get better, it may not, because that remains to be controlled by the market; the wage may go up, that can be forced by the law, but the law can not regulate every aspect of the job, and in those aspects the competition from the market [that can not be banned] reappears
	* if this change induced by the wage minimum [extra wage for extra work performance] was beneficiary for the employee then it self would choose it; it can, because the employer is usually flexible enough to pay more for more; but the employee considers more than the wage aspects too of work: family, time flexibility, leisure, safety, professional growth, carrier outlook, fun, self-realization
	* on paper the wage increase looks good and the marxist rulers get something to brag about, but really the net value of the job decreases, as what happens is only that choice is forced away from the employee; the employee gets forced by the ruler to perform better, for the sake of more tax revenue and popularity of the ruler
