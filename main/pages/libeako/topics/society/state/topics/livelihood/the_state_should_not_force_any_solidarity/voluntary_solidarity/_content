* solidarity has a voluntary version too; everyone knows its microsocial version: everyone tries to help their family, friends, even neighbors; a macrosocial version also exists : when people donate to people unknown to them, just generally, for example: for sick poor children
* nowadays [in 2019] the voluntary solidarity is diminished due to the state having taken over the activity
* in solidarity too: voluntary is better than forced
	* funding
		* unlike the voluntary one, the forced solidarity is built on taxing, which is expensive

	* spending
		* generally the state spends less efficiently than private entities, some reason of this are: rigidity, burocracy, corruption
		* private donators have more flexibility to judge indigence, and hence exclude those who would unnecessarily exploit the fund
		* people honor gifts given voluntarily
			* because:
				* those are given with good will and sacrificing self interest
				* of the shame and moral obligation to pay back coming with it
			* hence they try to:
				* minimize it
					* with the state forced charity the opposite is the situation; people consider it their right, they try to maximize the amount they take and they even waste it, mostly via gift seeking
						* link to gift seeking

				* make it a success
					* that is to stand up onto their on feet
					* with the state forced charity the opposite is the situation; that acts as a positive motivation to stay eligible [in need] for further charity
* voluntary charity is much bigger than people think
	* most people like to give; most people like to give only at some areas, but their very much, and they do
		* for example
			* creating educational material freely available in the internet
				* for example
					* the content of Wikipedia; its authors not only do not ask money for their work, but even credits, fame; still they created the single best encyclopedia ever, a greate source of learning for everyone
