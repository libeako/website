* this is the first such publication, a measurement, widely respected as scientific, which is said to have proved that wage minimum does not destroy jobs
* but the truth is that it is very far from being scientific
	* it contains many glaring and obvious neglegation of the most basic scientific requirements
		* if this work is to be considered as scientific measurement thrn it is scientific not in economics but in psychology, as example of the phenomenon that people (who are considered (by themselves and many others) to be scientists in the topic) invent and believe in and spread statements which are obviously false
	* already the title is false
		* it suggests that wage minimum causing job destruction is just a myth and that their small measurement debunks this myth; no, small measurements can not do that - can not disprove obvious truths
		* this is really not economics, but just a small measurement and some non-scientific conclusion from it
	* this is a sampling only
		* so far as sampling is proof: we could prove that wemen are taller than men, just be accidentally selecting such a man-woman pair for which this is true; even if we take many sample pairs: still some chance remains that in them the wemen are taller than the men; but this measurement of the authors have only 1 sample-pair
	* the use of the experimental and control group analysis
		* the authors say that they took this method from natural sciences; this method is widely known to be used in medicine research, for example; to determine the effects of a medicine: the people are devided into 2 groups: 'treatment', who take the medicine and 'control', who do not; the parameter of interest is measured for both groups before and after the treatment and then the difference in the in-group-by-time-difference is the bases of the outcome of the experiment; the author chose 2 directly nehgboring USA states as treatment and control samples, more precisely: low wage employees in them
	* the multiplicity of samples problem
		* a crucial scientific requirement for sample-based arguments is that the number of samples should be high, so that the probability of non-representative sampling be low; but this measurement contains not only not enoughly many samples, but only 1 sample-pair; because the samples are the 2 states; the employees can not be considered to be the samples, because they are dependent, they are under the same state, effected by the same laws
		* if in medicine somebody would suggest a 1 sample-pair sampling measurement as scientific - that person would be unonimously cinsidered to be a lunitic, not a scientist; but in economics this is treated okay, as economics is practiced not as science but as religion
		* though the authors mention that they had a few similar measurements about some other states in the past
	* the data is number of employees, but should be amount of worked time
	* the data does not take into account the changes compensation types other than wages
	* the survey was telephone questioning of restaurant managers about their employments
		* the questioned may have been biased to answer the popular answer
	* the managers may have anticipated the wage minimum increase before the survey, then the wage minimum effect may have got realized before the survey, hence not showing up in the by-time-difference
		* the plan to increase the wage minimum was announced 2 years before it really was law
	* several other effects may have masked the effect of the wage minimum increase
		* wealth effect
			* if people are more rich then they buy more service, including restaurant service
		* tax or other burdon decrease on restaurants

* the authors say that their findings are evidence that wage minimum does not destroy jobs
	* no, it is not evidence
		* not only we do not have reason to believe their numbers but even if those were genuine: they are still just very thin unreliable sampling
