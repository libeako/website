* this belief says: 'it is okay to take from x to y if y will exchange that with x for something'
* this belief is surprisingly popular
* examples
	* it is okay that country x supports country y with money because that money will be spent in x, hence the money stays in x
	* it is okay to rob from the employers for the employees [for example with wage minimum] because the employees will spend that extra money to buy stuff from the firms which is approximately the same set of actors as the employers
* this belief is obviously absurd
	* it says that an exchange cancels a gift
		* but
			* when v is gifted then the giver loses and the taker gets the whole value of v
			* when v is exchanged then the taker gets only the net value [the profit] of the exchange, which is less by the cost of the other side of the exchange; this net value is only a marginal portion of the value of v
