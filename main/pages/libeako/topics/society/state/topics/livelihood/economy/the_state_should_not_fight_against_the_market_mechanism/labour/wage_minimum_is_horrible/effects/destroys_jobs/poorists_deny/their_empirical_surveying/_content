* but these are not evidences; they are unreliable surveys, even the interpretations of which are stupid
	* a list of such surveys

			* i only read the "abstract"
				* the boldest claim in it is "we find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment"
					* thus they do not claim that wage minimum does not destroy jobs, they only claim that this particular measurement of them does not indicate that

			* i read only the "abstract"
				* it does not say that wage min does not destroy jobs
	* for the measurement to be accepted as scientific: it must be reproducible; so what are the intructions to repreduce these 'evidence's? appearantly to me: only that do a difference-in-difference test on a state-pair
		* it seems that some survey doers got to opposite results with this method
			* examples

	* in the defense of wage minimum_ one could say that it does not destroy jobs in some situations; but what are the exact conditions of those situations? i did not find the answer to this question in the marxists writings
