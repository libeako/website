* destroys jobs

* decreases the wage of some of the workers who stay employed
	* less opportunity to hide wage from taxing by reporting less then the real wage
		* more tax paid => less wage the worker gets
	* some employments are continued, but unlawfully; this is significant amount of worry and risk for at least the employer, increasing the cost of such employment, hence decreasing the profit on such employment,hence decreasing the price [wage] of such employment

* takes away choice from those staying in white work
	* some employees get wage increase after wage minimum increase
		* most people interpret this phenomena as a cause, erroneously considering correlation as causation; they think the wage minimum increase caused the wage increase [as their marxist politicians promised]; but what happens in most of the cases is that
			* they happen in the same time not because one causes the other but because they are caused by the same cause; that cause is the natural free market move; when politicians smell that the market trend is wage increase, they hijack the popularity from it, increasing the wage minimum and then letting people assume that the wage increase anyway under happening happened because of their legislation action, to earn the credit
			* nominal wages are naturally increasing even in a market without waves
				* because of these usual causes
					* the currencies usually are inflated, they are losing value, hence the real wage to stay the same has to grow
					* the technology, hence the work efficiency is getting improved, hence the wage is growing
				* hence wage increases are naturally happening usually; this is the reason why politicians can keep increasing the wage minimum
			* employees are of course aware of the constant habit of the state increasing the wage minimum; they do not want it and to ease their compliance to it while still minimizing the wages they time-synchronize the wage increases [that they would do anyway mostly] to the increases in the law
	* some employees do get a wage increase because of the wage minimum - this is bad for them

* thus those staying in the work affected by the wage min law get overloaded while some forced out of work have their work ability and will wasted
* if it worked
	* but let us suppose the practically impossible pink story about the wage minimum that its shocialist supporters tell: that it can force money to the employee, without the negative effects previously described; then this is a tax, from the customers of the employer [the employer surely will not operate with negative profit, it pushes the tax over to its client]; but extra taxes are bad for the economy; it is better for the economy and for the cleanness of politics too to not disturb the business word with tax differences and instead apply a uniform tax; that is, increasing the general value added tax is a better solution; an even better one is to decrease the tax of employment [if it is applied] at low wage [to avoid forcing the wealth to go through the state [because both taxing and giving away money has extra costs]]
* who benefits from the wage minimum law?
	* it is bad for the employees [mostly for them], for the customers and everyone in the society by decreasing the efficiency of the economy; who benefits? only the shocialist rulers:
		* people mistakenly think that they are protect the wage minimum is good for the people, hence the politicians pushing it gain popularity
		* the wage minimum increases the tax revenue
