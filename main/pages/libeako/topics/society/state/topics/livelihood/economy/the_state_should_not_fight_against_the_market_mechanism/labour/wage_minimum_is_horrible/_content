* a wide misbelief about the wage-minimum is that it guarantees a minimum in the wage; but really it guarantees only the following [or perhaps not even this]: the wage will be either minimum or zero
* really the wage minimum is not a guarantee but rather a constraint: an artificial, state induced limit of what voluntary exchanges employers and employees can make
* foundation and debunking of the reason of wage minimum
	* the foundation is the thinking that everybody's work is worth at least whatever the state sets the wage minimum and earning less is exploitation by the employer
	* both parts of this statement are false
		* employers generally can not exploit the employees

		* many reasons exist of the wage being very low
			* for example:
				* if the employee
					* is unexperienced
						* spends its work time much with learning
						* perhaps even causing more cost by asking and making mistakes then producing
					* has mental or other illness
					* has difficult personality
						* decreasing the inclinations of colleagues and clients
					* often is late or otherwise undisciplined
					* already drank its brain away
				* the task is leisure
					* for example:
						* being ready for some action, while free to read whatever wants
* arguments pro the wage minimum
