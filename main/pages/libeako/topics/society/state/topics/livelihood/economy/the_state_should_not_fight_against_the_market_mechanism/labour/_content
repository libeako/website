* deserve of wage comes not from working hard but from being promised
	* hence employees deserve not a high wage or 'living' wage or 'fair' but the promised wage
	* it is not okay to agree to an exchange and then claim that you think you deserve more; you ought to negotiate the conditions of the exchange before the exchange
* wage is voluntary compensation of labour; the forced part of the wage is not really wage, it is robbed loot; hence raising wages hire is conceptually impossible, as the forced extra wage is not really wage, it is lied to be wage
* the wage quantity - foundational economy lesson
