* private use of the state as weapon
	* the state can be used as weapon by anyone; more precisely i mean: its justice system can be used as weapon; for example i can hide prohibited to possess stuff [drugs, ...] in the target person's car, apartment, bag and notify the police anonymously about it; then the state will commit violence against the target person, even perhaps jail it; thus i can achieve serious harm against someone by using the state; these criminal acts should be punished with the same strictness as if the criminal does the harm itself instead of using the state [as if the criminal kidnapped and kept the target person captive himself for the duration of the jail sentence]; to my surprise : under many states this is not the situation
