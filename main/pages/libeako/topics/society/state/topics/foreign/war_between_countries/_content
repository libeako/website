* the principle of the innocence of the people of the other country
	* the people of an other country should not be considered enemies, but only the decision maker few concrete persons
		* the people are just like the people of any other country, the difference in their thoughts compared to other countries' people is due only to education and propaganda that they took, not their moral or human attitude
	* rather let a few decision makers die by assassination than thousands of ordinary soldiers or regular people in conventional battlefields
		* almost always though : the decision makers make the opposite decision
* the best solution for conflicts, including inter-country wars is to debate who is right and wrong in what exactly in the conflict
	* debates do not have any negatives
		* debates do not have any danger to anybody
		* debates do not have any cost
			* even the time they require is practically 0
	* debates [especially are president level] are more difficult to stop getting to the voters of the war-waging countries
	* the root of the war is some difference in the opinions of the 2 sides
		* till that difference exists - it is going to remain a driving force for continuation or renewal of war
			* hence any solution based not on debating away the difference [like negotiation based on relative strengths] - is not a durable solution
		* when that difference is gone - the war ends naturally and durably
		* hence a right way and the only right way to end a war is to make the opinion difference away - a method and the only method that can do that is public debate [who has the right on what, why, who committed what crime, what compensation is due]
* the direct fighting should be done by robots, the modern human soldier is information technologist in the background
	* human soldiers do not need to die on the modern battlefield, robots take that over, robots are even more efficient [economically, millitarily]
	* when i tell this to normies: they laugh me; as if they saw a sci-fi-retard in me; people do not see further from their nose, they assume that things are as they are because how they are is the right way and they are confident in this stupid way of thinking
	* robots can be moving ["drone"] or stationary [like a mine, an observation post]
	* robots can be flying, stepping, rolling, swimming
	* the only requirement for robots: they do not contain human pilots
	* hence robots must be controlled remotely in real time or pre-programmed to be autonomous, or the mixture of these
	* radio connection cam be jammed; but 
		* the connection does not always have to be radio
			* it often can be optical and wired too
		* the jammers are loud, hence they are relatively easy to locate and located objects can be destroyed [the jammed robot itself may be able to destroy its own jammer]
		* the jammed robot returning to its launch position - is already a very useful autonomy, while being usually easy to achieve; such an interrupted mission is already successful and useful as information gathering
	* even today's artificial intelligence is capable to control a robot for much more than return to launch position; detection of millitary objects, classification, autonome maneuvering are already easy tasks for the current state of artificial intelligence; but that is the bulk of millitary operations; future artificial intelligence will quickly go much beyond that, in swarm cooperation, complex planning
	* 'why do we not seeing the robots fighting, if they are so good?'
		* we are seeing the quick increase in their application
		* the better question is why did we not see their application earlier, why were the states withou a robot ary even in 2002?
			* because just as normies, the decision makers in the armies are also not capable or not willing to think beyond their noses; this is worsened by much by the fact that armies operate very inefficiently; the whole state operated very inefficiently, but armies even more so, because the voters are interested and knowledgable even less in them and they have less visibility to the outside
	* 'robots are expensive, they need "millitary-grade" material and engineering design'
		* what is "millitary-grade"? normal quality is good enough for most millitary applications; even the remote controlled toys are much more useful than no robot at all
	* even already in 2010 remote controlled toys with cameras appeared in mass, they were easy and cheap enough to mass-produce as toys; it is in front of everyone eyes, it was obvious; and the millitary decision makers in the states still did not care about them
* forcing men into the army is a special taxation
	* a very harsh one, as such it is very immoral and very inefficient economically, millitarily
