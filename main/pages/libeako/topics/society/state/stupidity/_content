* people are often more stupid in groups
	* links-to internal gkhqidnmmixpvelj
* state-politics is mostly a special case of this
* state-politics by large determined by stupidity of the citizens
* the rational part of it
	* citizens neglect state-politics
		* this is known as 'rational ignorance'
		* it is not worth for the citizen himself to spend time and effort into learning and thinking about politics
			* because the fruit of that intellectual work [the country being better] gets divided by the number of citizens
			* hence doing this work would require altruism towards the other citizens, including a lot of people who themselves do not will to give the same altruism, who are often even malicious and angry at those who try to improve politics
* the psychical part of it
	* citizens love the state
		* why this is is beyond me
		* they try to excuse the bad actions of their sates, even when those actions are obviously bad
		* they judge social issues very differently depending on whether the state is involved or not
	* citizens love to be decieved by the lord-candidates
		* they feel sweet satisfaction in hearing and reading from the candidates what they want to hear or read, even when it is obvious that the candidate is only talking so to gain votes
		* they rather dip into the sweetness of hope then do even the most basic thinking; i feel as if thinking was exluded by their brain as painful or obstructing hope and other sweet feelings
* some instances of this stupidity
	* 'voting is consent to the state and its laws'
