* in 2010-2018 i noticed that private legal text [treaties] are very often highly biased towards the side who ordered the text from the lawyer who wrote it
* mostly : the customers of the text are private companies and the other side of the treaty are the multiple business parties, their employees and customers
* they can get away with it because
	* the average person does not read legal text, instead "just sign"s it
* how is the text biased
	* "i will do everything possible"
		* no, you should not sign that; doing everything is slavery; you should always insist that you do only what is expectable from you
	* indemnity
		* you have to promise to indemnify them even if you are not guilty, even if you did not do anything wrong morally, even if you did not break any law or rule, even if the allegation against is you is just a pure claim and no proof that you really did what they say you did
		* they may reserve the right to settle, compromise without a trial as they want and then you have to refund them for that settlement; imagine that this is even a great scam opportunity for them : someone accuses you for some not even proven action then they settle without trial [pay the accuser] and you have to refund that settlement - it is a mechanism that can pull money from you without any limit
		* i understand that companies introduced their requirement for indemnity because initially they were and even now still are the victims, as lawmakers punished them for actions by their users - but still : the broadness of wording of the indemnity clauses in treaties went too far
