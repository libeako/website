* here i want to show how abstract, theoretical thinking can be vastly superior to practice
* nowadays it is widely believed that perpetual machines do not exist; the argument is a theory : the conservation of energy; nowadays nobody would question this, even laypersons agree; but the situation was not always thus; a few centuries ago the theory of energy conservation was not strong and some people did experiment with creating a perpetual machine
* i invite you to a thought experiment : imagine that the theory of energy conservation is not accepted today; then, because of the high value in the perpetual technology : professional mechanical engineering teams are trying to design and implement a perpetual machine; the biggest corporations invest much capital into this work and states invest even more; one engineering team is studying the oil types with the least friction; an other engineering team studies the optimal shapes of gear wheels; yet an other engineering team develops the most sensitive and precise measuring technology; and the tests are repeated at different temperatures, with different part sizes; they test all the combinations of all the free variables; they are coming close, they sometimes report promising measurement results, suggesting success
* and then a theoretical physicist comes and starts a debate :
* theorist : the energy of a closed system is constant, new energy can not be created, hence a perpetual machine can not be created
* engineers : our empirical results show otherwise
* theorist : then those measurements must be wrong, perhaps you calibrated your measuring devices inaccurately
* engineers : our measuring technology is state of the art, it is result of decades of research, development and empirical validation
* theorist : still, something must be wrong with it
* engineers : sorry, how much time did you spend studying the measuring science?
* theoriest : zero
* engineers : and you still think that you know better than hundreds of engineers who worked their whole carrier in this subject?
* theoriest : yes
* engineers : you are ridiculous
* and thus would think almost everybody else too
* but we now know that the theorist would be right; the lesson to learn from this thought experiment is that sometimes a simple theory can be superior over vast investment of practice, and the practice can be popular despite theoretical disproof, just because the side of the practice is supported by strong human will
* an other good example is religion : an atheist would be sure that god does not exist, despite billions of people [including theologists who spent their lives studying the subject] thinking otherwise, despite even not having read from the bible
* an other good example is economy : some people [capitalists] are sure that the state can not support the economy purely by taxing and spending, despite the states and mainstream economists thinking the opposite
