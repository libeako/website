* often the choice of name for a concept is bad; choices of names are controlled by the usage of names, by people who use them; the naming bad may cause the naming to be confusing or misleading; this hurts especially those who are learning it, learning alone is difficult already; people who are not familiar with the concept are often not aware of the mistake in the name choice; people who are familiar with the concept are mostly used to it and do not want to change it; always some people exist who are just learning the concept; they may find the bad naming misleading, confusing; they perhaps want to change the name; but those who already are used to the name are more numerous, because one learns a concept for using it for more time then it took to learn it; hence the newcomers give up to the force of the majority and start using and get used to the bad name themselves; this phenomena causes bad naming to stick around for long time; even for generations; even though the overall amount of confusion may be more then the effort for the currently using generation to change the name; actually it is surely more because by the time passing the amount of hurt the badness of the naming causes grows linearly, while the effort of changing a name is constant; hence it is wise to do the name change so soon as possible
