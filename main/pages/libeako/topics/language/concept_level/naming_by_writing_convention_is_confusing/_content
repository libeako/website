* you should not name a thing about how you express it in writing; especially not if the choice of expression in writing is arbitrary
* examples
	* "left-, right-cancellable"
		* in algebra : regarding a binary operation ∘ : f is left-cencalleble when for all x, y : f ∘ x = f ∘ y => x = y
		* from this writing of the definition it is easy how the name originated; but it is wrong name
		* "f ∘ x" is arbitrary syntax, we could also use "f <<< x" or "x >>> f"
		* hence we could use "x >>> f", the order in which is opposite; welcome to a hell of confusion
		* instead use "early-", "late-cancellable", which are independent of choice of writing
	* "left-, right-adjoint"
