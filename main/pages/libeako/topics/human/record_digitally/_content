* the quality of the health service is a determining factor in our lifes; with a little will we could enhance it by a lot; by recording the processes digitally; now most healers do most of their work so that the patients and their families see very little from it; this is especially true for the more serious cases, like intensive care, but still true generally too
* instead the processes should be
	* recorded onto sound, video, picture, text recording; surgeries, discussions, examination, laboratory tests, everything
	* immediately uploaded to the server of the healing institute
		* signed, timestamped, encrypted
* this would make
	* the patient or its family able to 
		* seek secondary professional opinion, to lower the chance of professional mistakes
			* also, this would potentially uncover wrong practices by doctors
				* quite many wrong practice exist now and the doctors tend to stick to it when no other professional points them out; healers are easily confident [in doing mistakes] when only non-professional watch their activity
		* know everything about the status of the healing process without disturbing the healers
	* prevent healers the ability to deny their mistakes and misconducts
		* in turn this would motivate them to do a much better job
* the recording technology already exists, it is trivially simple and cheap and available - only the cultural will is missing
