* the knowledge acquired under force lasts only till the force lasts and gets forgotten with pleasure when the force ceases
	* how much did you forget from your school learning material? how much of the questions in those exams could you answer now?
		* i was forced to read some art books; it stole a lot of my time; not  only i do not remember their content, but i do not even remember which books they were
		* in physics : the notion of work is very fundamental; can you remember its formula?
		* can you still integrate a polynomial?
		* ...
* real knowledge can be acquired only by curiosity coming from inside
* forced learning causes stress
* the stressful load takes away the brain capacity from the child to do real learning
* bad marks tell the child it is stupid and educational "experts" tell the parent "the child can not concentrate", but really just the child is not interested in that topic then; rebelling against forced learning is not a behavior problem, it is an understandable, even healthy reaction
* some children of course hate what is forced on them, just because of the force in it, especially if it is also difficult for them
* "but children do not not want themselves to learn"
	* no? then why
		* is even the smallest child just able to talk asking : "what is that?"?
		* do you regularly read and watch news, even as an adult, even after a tiring day of work?
	* because being curious, desiring to learn is a strong inner trait of humans
		* this is even more true for children
		* this is true for other species too
		* this is an evolutionary trait
			* look at young animals, they learn
				* the young cat learns how to fight each other, how to catch moving things, what animals are prey and what are danger
				* the young monkey learns how to crack nut
			* the ones that did not learn died without giving over their genes; hence the evolution burnt the desire to learn into animals, and especially for their young time
			* the more a species relied on cleverness - the more important learning was for it; humans are the most clever animals since 30 million years already
		* in each species the young have the desire to learn the necessary skills to become successful adults and they do learn; humans are not exceptions
* "but the child itself is interested in stupid things"
	* the opposite is the reality
	* they are the adults who deicide children to learn stupid things
		* 200 years old national folklore
		* kings
			* their names, dates, battles, politics from hundreds of years ago, which has almost no relevance for the future
		* arts
			* arts are about emotion, those can not be forced to understand
			* much of the art taught to children is serious, they require 10s of years of life experience to understand, which the children do not yet have
		* memorization
			* which town is the capital of which country, what the country produces, ...
		* outdated technologies
			* i had to learn to manually draw characters with millimeter precision on mechanical engineering drawings, and to do it for many hours, even though it was clear for me, a child who never used internet, that this kind of work is for computers
	* often the ability to decide the children's educational material is abused to brainwash them
		* nationalism
			* "we are one nation, you are a member of us"
			* "our language is beautiful and exceptional"
			* "our history is mighty"
		* religion
			* "our god is the one and only one; the satan sent agents to say otherwise"
		* tyranny
			* i still remember these ones :
				* "Lenin was carrying large chunks of wood each Saturday in the Kreml; and Lenin always took the heavier side"
				* "communists are good people"
			* "you must obey the leader"
		* ...
		* tribe mentality is programmed for children even today, even in many developed, relatively politically free countries
	* what do children prefer to learn?
		* the cyber world
			* they discovered it themselves, long before the adults started to teach it, and they continue to be ahead relative to the adults in it , usually they teach it to the adults
		* the english language
		* life
			* personal [friend, romantic, sexual] relationships
				* this is the most important aspect of life
		* modern, popular [real] art
		* politics
			* soon they will vote
	* one can achieve nothing good by forcing thought or emotion
* "children would spend too much time on the internet, Youtube"
	* what do you think they do there? they learn a lot there : real life stories, language, politics, art, life issues
* "children would spend too much time partying and with the opposite sex"
	* and even in this question they know better than the adults
		* they learn social interaction, social emotion, which will be crucial after only a few years they will have to marry and start their own families
		* the friendships they make in their young time will be much more help for them in their adult life than to remember when the Waterloo battle happened
* individuals differ much; the child [as any human] has individual emotions, thoughts, interests, desires; only it knows itself as an individual, only it can build itself; only it can walk its road to adulthood, the adults can only help, suggest, warn
* you can not program children like you do it with computers; humans are not machines
