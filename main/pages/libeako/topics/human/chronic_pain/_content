		* i am not a medic. i share my story and my understanding of it as an amateur
	* i honestly think you should consult with professional medic about any pain you have; the pain is a signal of potential tissue damage that must be investigated by professionals
* if and only if professional healers did not find any tissue damage then it is time to think about the following :
* our pain system is complex and delicate
	* evolution did not teach to our pain system how to handle serious health issues, beceause it was not necessary, because individual animals with serious health issues died anyway
* sensitization
	* much of the chronic pain is caused by the brain sensitizing the pain; after that even simple sensations can be interpreted as serious pain
	* worrying about health issues causes the brain to concentrate on the place of issue and to sensitize the pain
	* some kinds of pain [for example joint] rise after a delay [often a day] after an injury or overloading; this causes the brain to interpret the initial level of pain too small, hence to sensitize that kind of pain
	* note that sensitized pain you feel does not have to be felt as invented; it is not like you think about whether you have pain or not and conclude that you have; instead it may be spontaneous; because it can be the sensitized version of any spontaneous feeling, like ordinary mild pressure
	* if a health issue lasts for long [years or decades] than the sensitization have much time to grow big even if it happens slowly
	* my story

* chronic pain is a matter of attitude
	* except perhaps some illnesses with serious pain, for example total erosion of joint cartridge
	* it happens in the brain and the brain can suppress it; try to not think about it; after you investigated the potential tissue issue : tell yourself that the pain is false signal
	* one of my rheumatologists told me that she had patient who already could not move his joint buy still did not feel pain and had patient [like me] who appearantly did not have tissue damage but still felt pain
	* some people like to complain, to show as a victim; do not be telling other people that you have pain, because by that you program your own brain too to feel pain
* an analogy
	* if the lamp on the dashboard signalling the operational readiness of the engine does not light then it is time to investigate the issue at a car-healer; but if multiple car-healers do not find problem in the engine then it is time to think that the problem is in the signalling lamp
* painkiller drugs
	* our brain controls the pain in long time; it can both sensitize and mute it incorrectly
	* for long time pain : pain killer drugs
		* are not necessary
			* one can achieve pain suppression via mental change
		* they do not work
			* they only work temporarily and when one needs to stop applying them then the effectis reversed
		* they have side effects
	* doctors prescribe painkillers too easily
		* one prescribed it to me even though i stated that my pain level is signaling, not suffering
		* one prescribed to my grandma just because she said she have mch pain; she did not, she likes to complain and live through pain; the doctor did not even investigate whether the pain is chronic
