* one of the many if not the most legendary audiophile headphone
* the skeleton seems to be strong, gives confidence
	* more than with the Sennheiser 5 types
* comfort is good
	* mass is low
	* advantage over Sennheiser 5 types is that those contain a small bumb in the inside of the cups
	* the headband padding is not so comfy as with the cheaper Sennheiser 5** headphones, i did feel hotspot on my head.
* overall
	* good headphone but not great, not up to its fame
		* i still enjoy my Superlux 672 much more
			* the Superlux has much better separation
			* the Superlux is more melodic, musical, easier to hear the artistic intent, the Sennheiser 650 is boring, comperatively
			* the Superlux is much more clear, the Sennheiser is very slightly sibilant, textured, comperatively, which may contribute to the false sense of resolution
	* i do not see a big jump in quality from Sennheiser 5** headphones, not even in the sound
* 600
	* my first surprise was that the sound is somewhat soar, but this feeling disappeared later
	* stage is said to be very small; i was afraid ot this but it does not bother me, it is even pleasant; the stage of the 650 did bother me
	* frequency response: very neutral
	* timbre is too dry, a texture added by the headphone
		* like if i was listening to loud-speakers
	* dynamism is too low - makes the sound feel flat
	* separation is good
	* easy to listen to for long time
	* the sound for me is muddy and not just a little but much muddy; so much that i highly recommend to not buy this headphone; this is independent of its frequency response; rather: learn to equalize and buy a Superlux 672 [with better earpads] instead; the 672 is more clean and dynamic and even more comfy; the Sennheiser HD 6** headphones are over-hyped and over-priced, forget them, unless you very much want to avoid both equalizing
* 650
	* sounds similar to hd 600, unsurprisingly
	* it is laid back, but less so than Sennheiser 598 and Game One are
	* has some punch, unlike the Sennheiser 5 types, but this punch is not a pleasant one for me
	* has some real base, more than the Sennheiser 5 types
	* stage is even across the space dimensions but it is small, just at my head surface
	* has some old style, as if i went back into the 80s, similar to the sound of cheap Koss headphones
