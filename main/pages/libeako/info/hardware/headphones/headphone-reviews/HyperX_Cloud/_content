* one weakness of these headphones is their pleather pads; they usually have thin outer layer, which deteriorates quickly and with high probability; many people complain about this problem in public forums
* the types
	* Stinger
		* comfort: very good, everything, more comfy than Cloud 1, 2, Alpha
		* sound
			* sibilant, grainy in the highs - strong problem
			* otherwise it would be very good
	* Cloud 1, 2
		* these types are the same, so far as i know, except that the 2 has a DAC+amp to it too
		* with the pleather pads the base decay is very slow, i feel that every sound swims in big warm muddy 200 Herz base
		* with the velour pads
			* the base problem is not present at all
			* sounds thin, airy [sibilant]
				* this decreases the resolution, by my perception
				* this would be disliked by many, i guess
				* i kinda liked it
	* Alpha
		* comfort is bad; both the earpads and the headband pads are rude
		* sound
			* clean, very resolving, metalic
			* stage is very pleasant; it is big enough and somewhat aritificially increased by some reverb; this reverb is a coloring, a distortion from fidelity but is a suprisingly pleasant distortion; i see its existence bad but i am somewhat a trained audiophile; i like fidelity; most people though would find this reverb to be tasteful, even addictive and would even perhaps miss it when changed to an other headphone type; also some distortion on closed headphone usually exist, if i have to compromise with some distortion i would happily accept this one
