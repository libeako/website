* in mathematics : reasoning about non-existent mathematical objects may lead to invalid judgements; hence it is necessary to know that a mathematical object exists before we use that object; the science field of existence is "ontology"
* ontology
	* set theory is very good for ontology
	* pure sets
		* set theory uses pure sets only
		* pure sets are
			* the empty set
			* sets containing only pure sets
		* pure sets are very simple, unambiguous, surely existing objects
	* axioms
		* multiple axiom sets are suitable, the most commonly used is "ZFC"; it is simple, intuitive
	* representation
		* all mathematical objects may be represented by pure sets, and all their interesting properties can be proven solely building on the axioms of set theory
		* examples
			* product
				* (x, y) := {x, {x, y}}
			* natural numbers
				* 0 := {}
				* 1 := {{}}
				* 2 := {{{}}}
				* 3 := {{{{}}}}
				* ...
* abstraction
	* foundational set theory is good in implementing interfaces but bad in defining interfaces
	* example : in the representation of natural numbers by pure sets
		* one natural number is an element of its successor
		* this is a property not of the natural numbers but of this representation of it
		* so this representation captures the natural numbers imprecisely
	* because of this : set theory does not help mathematicians and software coders in defining abstractions
	* in this role category theory is emerging
