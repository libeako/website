* the functions being real mathematical functions makes it easier to reason about the program
* functional code is just a set of real mathematical equations, which are true always during the execution of the program; one can use the fact that if he sees "y = f x" in the code then that equation [as a property of the program] will always be true; this property is often referred to by the phrase "referential transparency" and it enables "equational reasoning"
* equational reasoning is useful both for the humans and for the compiler to
	* prove other interesting properties
	* runtime efficiency optimization
