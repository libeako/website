* an enum type is one with its values enumerated with names in the definition
* to introduce the syntax, here is an example:
* datatype Color =     | green     | blue     | red
	* ## class
		* code-block
* just as an interesting example : the Bool type can be defined with it :-)
	* datatype Bool =     | false     | true
		* ## class
			* code-block
* the number of cases may = 1
	* datatype Singleton =     | single
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* though in practice: more often the 0-tuple is used as a singleton type, becaue that one is part of the language, while such a 'Singleton' is at library level
* the number of cases may = 0
	* datatype Void =
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* exactly 0 value exists with type Void
	* such type is sometimes named "Absurd"
