* is an application of a function to less actual inputs than the number of its designed inputs
* then the result of the function application expression is a function that expects actual inputs for the rest of the designed formal inputs
	* formally:
		* f   : a -> b -> c
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* =>
		* f x :      b -> c
			* ## class
				* code-block
* function application is left associative
	* examples
		* f x y = (f x) y f x y z = ((f x) y) z
			* ## class
				* code-block
	* this is in nice consistency with partial function application, because by this (f x) is a sub-expression of (f x y); by this: partial function application is not a special language construct, but a natural capability, which is awesome
* example
	* plus x y = x + y  increment x = plus 1 x
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* remember that 
	* increment x = plus 1 x
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* is only a syntactical sugar of 
	* increment = (\ x -> plus 1 x)
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* because (\ x -> f x) is equivalent to f:
	* increment = plus 1
		* ## class
			* code-block
	* is a valid way to define 'increment; and a neat one
* order of the inputs
	* to enable partial function application in greatest scope: inputs are often ordered flipeed to what imperative programmers are used to
	* examples
		* map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b  filter : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* the advantage of this "reverse" order is hopefully demonstrated by the following example:
		* filter_then_map : (a -> bool) -> (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* first attempt to define 'filter_then_map':
		* filter_then_map p f l = map f (filter p l)
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* using that f (g x) = (g >>> f) x:
		* filter_then_map p f l = ((filter p) >>> (map f)) l
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* dropping l from both sides:
		* filter_then_map p f = filter p >>> map f
			* ## class
				* code-block
		* this is much neater than the first attempt to define 'filter_then_map'; to make ourselves able to use 'filter' and 'map' such neatly is why the input order of them are what they are
