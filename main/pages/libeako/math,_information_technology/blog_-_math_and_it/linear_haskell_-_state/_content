* linear typing is a type system feature; as such it makes some runtime efficiency improvements possible and some bugs impossible; linear typing tracks that some values are used exactly once and is very useful feature
* the idea of linear typing for haskell has been explored for some years; a proof of concept version is implemented; i estimate the final product is 2-5 years away
* Simon Peyton Jones's presentation

* this presentation is very concise but still more understandable then most sources in this topic; it does not require prior knowledge in the topic; i highly recommend it as an introduction
* we have some causes by which to be optimistic about linear haskell 
	* Simon Peyton Jones feels it feasible
	* the solution is fully backward compatible
	* they implemented a proof of concept version and it works [compiles the haskell compiler]
	* the implementation is small
	* laziness does not interfere
	* the design space seems widely explored
* summary : the future of linear haskell seems bright though far
