* "Alex Küronya : Introduction to Topology"
	* i read only a small portion of this book, but it seems good; compact, understandable
* "Huỳnh Quang Vũ : Lecture notes on Topology"
	* i did not read this book but seems good. It seems to concentrate onto only the most important things, gives a very wide coverage.
