* for example : collections are type functions
* polymorphism on type functions as a programming language feature is also know as "higher kinded types"
* certain interfaces of type functions are indispensable in software coding
	* for example: functor, applicative, monad
* thus type function polymorphism is a must-have programming language feature for efficient software coding;  currently the only industrial programming languages prividing this feature are haskell and scala
