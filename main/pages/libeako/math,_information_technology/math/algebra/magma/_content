* has
	* 1 sort
	* 1 2-ary operation
	* 0 laws
* the operation may be named "combine"
* in programming :
	* interface Magma t     combine : t -> t -> t
		* ## class
			* code-block
* because the absence of laws, we do not know anything about the operation; so this structure is equivalent to a function of type t->t->t and hence is not interesting; at this point i can admit to you : its most numerous usage is like here, as the most introductory example of abstract algebra
