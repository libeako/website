* what is a category?
	* a generalization of monoid
		# links-to internal kdrjpfoaockqycybn
	* formally :
		* the slots :
			* objects
			* arrows
		* the operations :
			* here i use very precise types, parameterizing the type of arrows and objects with object values
			* source : (x ~> y) -> x target : (x ~> y) -> y
				* ## class
					* code-block
			* empty : x -> (x ~> x)
				* ## class
					* code-block
			* (>>>) : (f : x ~> y) -> (g : y ~> z) -> (x ~> z)
				* ## class
					* code-block
		* the laws are like of monoid
			* the composition is associative
			* the empty values must behave neutrally in composition
* some examples of categories
	* some famous ones
		* functions between sets
		* the category of programming
			# links-to internal gxrbghpwcjceccgun
		* in logic
			* implications between statements
			* proofs of implications between statements
		* homomorphisms between algebras
		* [partial] orderings
		* paths of directed graphs
		* transformations between coordinate systems
	* it is easy to create interesting sub-categories of these by constraining the collection of objects or the collection of arrows
