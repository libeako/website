* the word "algebra" is used for multiple unrelated things in mathematics; the one this section is about is a field of mathematics that studies collections of values with "additional structure"
* what is an "algebra" ?
	* it  is similar [in certain aspects] to what a type is in programming
	* it is a tuple (values operations laws)
		* "values" is a set of values [also named "objects"]
			* like a type in programming has a set of values
		* "operations" are functions from a tuple of values to a value
			* like methods of types in programming; though in an algebra the output has the same single type as the values
			* also can be named with "method"
		* laws
			* these are mathematical statements about ["properties" of] the operations
				* most often equalities
* the collection of values is often named with these other phrases : "base collection", "sort", "slot", "type", "carrier"
* "arity" of an operation
	* is the number of inputs of the operation
	* an "n-ary" operation has n inputs
	* some common aliases
		* "nullary" = 0-ary
			* a 0-ary operation is a constant; it points out an element of the collection
		* "unary" = 1-ary
		* "binary" = 2-ary
* 2-ary operations
	* in the following when an algebra has only 1 of them : i will use symbol ⊕ for its infix form
	* some famous predicates on them:
		* commutativity
			* for-all x y
				* x ⊕ y = y ⊕ x
		* associativity
