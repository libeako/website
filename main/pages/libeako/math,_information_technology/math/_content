* i am a programmer, enthusiast of programming language and base library science; hence most of the material here is from this perspective

* topics
	* the most basic categorization of math knowledge in my opinion is ("discrete" | "quantitative")
		* discrete is about discrete mathematical objects, while quantitative is about continuous scales of quantities;
		* theoretical foundation of math is discrete; but discrete also is applied very much; quantitative feels more like purely applied
		* quantitative applies discrete, and the opposite is very rear; hence discrete seems the one to learn first
