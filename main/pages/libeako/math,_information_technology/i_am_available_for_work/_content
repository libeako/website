	* my dream job would be (programming language design) or (base library design and implementation)
	* i would provide cunsultency, lectures 
		* for software coders and production managers 
		* in the topic of programming languages, functional programming, strong static typing
		* to promote a much better coding methodology than what almost all of the software industry is using
			* more about this

	* i was programming for 11 years, mostly as an algorithm developer, mostly using c++, c#
	* i learned software engineering theory from the web, realized that the industry's way of doing it is stupid and wrote a book about this

* what i am like
	* i like to understand the theoretical layer
	* i make my decisions with lasting product in mind, like to put them on an elegant theoretical foundation
	* i tend towards the principled decisions
	* i like to do the right thing
	* i am obsessed with making the source-code bug-safe, repetition-free, modular, elegant
	* i like to teach
	* i am lazy
	* i feel i have a good sense for user interface design
