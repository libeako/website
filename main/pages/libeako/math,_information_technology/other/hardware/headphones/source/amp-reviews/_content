* Behringer UMC22 U-Phoria
	* this is a cheap but quality "audio interface"
	* it contains both an input and an output DAC+amp
	* thus it can function as a headphone amplifier too, as such it is neutral sounding but somewhat metalic, but it still is not difficult to listen to for long time
* FiiO E10K Olympus 2
	* cheap, small headphone amplifier
	* sound
		* clean, somewhat smoothed; no harshness, no sibilance, no metalic timbre
			* this makes it easy to listen to for long time
		* as if it was elevated at around 160 Herz
