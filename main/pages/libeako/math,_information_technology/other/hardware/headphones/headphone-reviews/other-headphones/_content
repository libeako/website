* Meze 99 Classic
	* this headphone is overpriced by 3 times; its sound is nothing worthy of fame; at least by my perception; i know that "Honest Audiophile" likes it very much
	* base is elevated by much
	* at around 300 Herz some resonance or other problem is present, i could not get rid of it with equalization
	* timbre is woody
* Sennhesier GSP 500
	* sound was okay
		* its transducer is totally different from the transducer of Sennheiser 5__ headphones
	* comfort was not good enough from a Sennheiser
* Behringer BH 470
	* this headphone is designed for travel: it is closed, base is elevated [this is usual with travel headphones], it is small, nice and elegant
	* mids have so prominant dip that equalization is very important with this headphone
	* when equalized: 
		* its sound is lovable, interestingly, i can not explain why
		* it is sibilant slightly, timbre is woody - this feels as noise, hurting resolution
	* comfort is good conpared to earcups such small in diameter; but compared for normal earcup size: this is too small and hence the comfort is not good enough for home and office use [when the headphone does not have to be small]
	* durability: i was surprised by the fact that it endured several years of use without sight of deterioriation; it lasted better than its price suggests
* AKG, mid tier, open back
	* these have a springy rope based suspension; those ropes are thin and flexible; they sometimes lose their strength, then the headphone sits on the outer ears of the user, instead of on the head-top; this is a problem often mentioned on public forums and my instance also had this problem; my one totally lost its strength, the suspension was sitting in its most long position; i still could wear and use the headphone but was uncomforting
	* the earpads are big and comfy
	* my instance was a 702
		* sound
			* open
			* stage is not small but not bigger than for example with the cheap Superlux open-back 50 mm headphones
			* being open and its transducer having only 40 mm diameter and seeing th edrequency response: i expected the base to be weak; but it was strong enough, clean and tight; was better than the base of Sennheiser 5__ open headphones [like 560S, Game One]
* AKG K361
	* this headphone is over-hyped and over-priced
	* comfort is not good enough for th eprice; nor the earpads, nor the headbend pad
		* the K371 is even more heavy, with the same headbend padding
	* sound
		* would be good, except one problem: the highs are grainy, quite much for such an expensive and hyped headphone type; i heard this grainyness certainly when i equalized it to the diffuse target
			* i read about the K371 somewhere that its highs are smoother
* Hifiman HE 400 se
	* comfort
		* headband is deeply padded but still not good enough because of the weight; i regularly get skin ache at the top of my head by its pressure
		* earpads are good; big in diameter and depth
	* sound: bad because sibilanc
		* sibilant; this is the big problem with the sound; otherwise the sound is quite good
		* lacks slam
