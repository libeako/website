* currently curved monitors are produced for a price extra, as if they were better; but in my opinion they are worse; because on flat monitors straight lines look straight from all view points but usually look curved on a curved monitor; straight lines are very important; they are ubiquitous building blocks of the graphical user interfaces, and are frequent even on pictures, as in movies and games, as physical objects often have straight features; when straight lines do not look straight then the brain must do additional work during the interpretation of the displayed picture to establish the info that the lines are straight; this additional work is mostly unconscious, but even so it is tiring; i personally happened to try a 32 inch curved monitor instead of my old 24 inch flat one; i wanted a bigger monitor for years; after 2 days of using the bigger curved one i was happy to get back to the smaller flat one
