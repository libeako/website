* as technology advances : importance moves from raw work to learning [how to work efficiently with new technology]; this should be reflected in our learn-work balance, but i see it is not, many people continue hard working, even though they should shift towards learning
* i advise you to reconsider your job; do you like it? do you want to continue it in the long time? are you satisfied with your wage? if not then you should consider to change into part time working and use the freed time for learning, learning whatever you are interested in : science, technology, finance, whatever
* do not be afraid to ask your employer for part time employment
	* if the employer wants the employee to work much then the employer values, needs that work; then the employer will need at least half of that work even more; hence the danger of getting fired is not present; the employer may tactically act so to frighten, but it usually is just that : a bluff
