YouTube star uploads video about her disciplining her dog. That is not a problem. But the reason for it is that the dog expresses love to her. In my opinion that shows a sick soul. Then the dog forgives and shows love again. The owner should be grateful for such a loving dog. But she punishes the dog again. And then again. She stands in front of the dog, knowing the dog is in playful mood, then acts as she was talking to a human, knowing that her opening her arms will be interpreted by the dog as invitation to jump. She knows the dog will jump on her, as an act of play. She still uses it as an excuse to punish.
She seemingly loves dishing out discipline. I hope she will not have children. Imagine all those opportunities to discipline. Even without her children inheriting her emotional traits.
Or an officer. This is one good reason why using police [the sate] is dangerous. Most people love power, but some will even seek and falsely fabricate opportunities to exercise it even just to feel the power, not only cruelly against innocent unknown people, but even against those who love them and are totally loyal to them. In the past the victims of such police officers went to jail for assault. And there were a lot of such cases, even in democratic countries. Nowadays the situation is somewhat better, but even with body cameras on we see a lot of cases the officer could not resist his|her urge to escalate the situation.
