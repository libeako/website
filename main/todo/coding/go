Compared to Java, C#:
	Type interface implementation is implicit.	
	Named return value - useless, but comlicates the language.
	'Defer' - what for?
	'Map's should not be part of the language.
Compared to most industrial languages:
	Wants to be high level language, but is very imperative; a high level language should be functional.
	No higher kinded types.
	Methods require an actual input.
	Methods can not be implemented conditionally.
	Dynamic type test.
